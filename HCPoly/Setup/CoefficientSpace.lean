# The high-contrast coefficient space

This file fixes the coefficient class of `s.introduction`: measurable
coefficient fields modulo equality almost everywhere that are uniformly elliptic
almost everywhere on every bounded set, together with the integer translation
action on them.

**Scope of the coefficient class.**  The coefficient space used here is the set
of measurable fields that are *locally* uniformly elliptic: on every bounded
subset of `ℝ^d` one pair of ellipticity constants serves almost every value of
the field there, the pair being attached to the field and to the set rather than
fixed in advance.  No constant appearing in any statement below depends on such
a pair, and no bound of the development is uniform over the coefficient space.
The class contains the fields uniformly elliptic almost everywhere on all of
`ℝ^d`. The paper's condition `e.qualitative.ellipticity` states local essential
bounds on `s`, `s⁻¹` and `kᵗ s⁻¹ k`, expressing local uniform ellipticity in
matrix terms. The coefficient class here also satisfies the weaker local
integrability conditions used by the analytic library. All quantitative
content — the reference aspect ratio `Π`, the
concentration gauge and its growth witness, the annealed contrast `Θ_m`, and
every dimensional constant — is unchanged.

**The canonical measurable structure on `Mat d`.**  Several modules of the
reference library introduce a measurable structure on `Mat d`, all of them the
entrywise product structure transported from `Fin d → Fin d → ℝ`; one of them,
`Homogenization.Book.Ch04.SourceObservable`, declares its copy `private`, which
hides the name but still registers the instance globally.  Whichever copy
instance resolution happens to select, `BorelSpace (Mat d)` is then searched for
*that* copy, and the two Borel instances of the reference library are stated for
two of the others, so a goal `BorelSpace (Mat d)` becomes unsolvable in any
import closure where the private copy wins.  The pair
`Homogenization.instMeasurableSpaceMat` and `Homogenization.instBorelSpaceMat`
is the canonical path, and it is raised here to a priority no other copy
reaches, so that every module of this library — both the polynomial-entry route
and the proofs of the other three theorems — resolves `MeasurableSpace (Mat d)`
and `BorelSpace (Mat d)` along one and the same path.  All the copies are the
same structure up to unfolding, so nothing stated for another of them stops
applying.

/-! ## The coefficient space `Ω` -/

/-- Qualitative local uniform ellipticity of a coefficient field: on every ball
around the origin there is a pair of ellipticity constants for which almost every
value of the field on that ball is uniformly elliptic in the sense of
`IsEllipticMatrix`, that is, coercive with a bounded inverse.

The constants are quantified inside the predicate: they belong to the field and
to the ball, and never enter an estimate.  Since every bounded set lies in a
ball, the same statement holds with an arbitrary bounded set in place of the
ball. -/

of the symmetric part, both follow. -/
