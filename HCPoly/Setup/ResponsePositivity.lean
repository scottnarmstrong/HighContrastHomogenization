# Positive definiteness of the coarse response on the coefficient space

Every field of the coefficient space is uniformly elliptic almost everywhere on
every bounded set, so on each triadic cube it agrees almost everywhere with a
measurable everywhere uniformly elliptic field, and the deterministic
coarse-graining theory gives positive definiteness of the coarse response of that
field.  Since the coarse response only sees the almost everywhere class of the
field on the cube, this is the sample-side half of the well-formedness that
`e.Theta.m` presupposes.
