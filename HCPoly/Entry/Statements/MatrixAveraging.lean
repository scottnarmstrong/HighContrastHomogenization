# Lemma `l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging` — finite-range matrix averaging

`l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging`, the paper's Lemma "Finite-range matrix averaging", transcribed from
the printed display.

Reading of the display, stated here so that no divergence is silent:

* `N ≥ 2` even is a natural number, coerced to the real Schatten index that
  `HCPoly/Entry/Setup/SchattenNorm.lean` takes; `‖·‖_{L^N(S_N)}` is `lqSchattenNorm`, real-valued under the real-valued reading.
* The display names no hypothesis on the coefficient law, because the manuscript's standing
  assumptions (`t.polynomial.entry`: a stationary, unit-range probability law satisfying coarse
  ellipticity `†`) are in force throughout; they are carried here in the binder order of the root statement `HCPoly/Entry/Statements/PolynomialEntry.lean`, and the proof of this lemma uses two of them
  (the range of dependence, for the independence of a colour class, and stationarity). The
  printed `𝐀hom_{j,q}` is meaningless without the law.
* `𝔪 > 0` is `Matrix.PosDef` and `q = 𝒬(𝔪)` is `Geometry.explicitRoundedGrid jStar m`; the standing
  `3^{j_*} ≥ 2d` near `e.rounded.grid.bounds` is `hj` and the standing `d ≥ 2` of `t.polynomial.entry` is `hd`.
  The display does not restate `𝔪 > 0`; `𝒬(𝔪)` presupposes it, and it is carried as `hm`.
* **The source lower scale is a standing hypothesis.** Near `e.source.lower.scale` reads "From now
  on `j_*` satisfies `e.source.lower.scale`", i.e. `j_* ≥ ⌈C_src(d,γ) log_3(2K_{Ψ_S})⌉` with
  `C_src` the constant of the source estimate (near `e.source.lower.scale`). That sentence stands from there
  onward, of the same kind as `3^{j_*} ≥ 2d` near `e.rounded.grid.bounds`: every later statement whose type
  mentions `j_*` carries it as a premise, whether or not its own display restates it, and whether
  or not its proof will use the source estimate. This display does not restate it; it is carried
  here as `hsrc`. `C_src` is existential in the outermost constant group, before the coefficient
  law and the geometry, since the manuscript fixes one such constant for the whole argument at
  `(d,γ)`; a universally quantified `C_src` would be a different, stronger claim.
* `Z` is a nonempty finite subset of `3^j q ℤ^d` = `adaptedLatticeAtScale q j`, as a `Finset` with its
  printed inclusion; `#Z` is `Z.card`.
* "a deterministic positive definite `2d`-by-`2d` matrix `R`" is a `BlockMat d` that is symmetric
  and `Book.Ch02.BlockPosDef` — the block analogue of Mathlib's `Matrix.PosDef`, whose symmetry
  the manuscript's positive matrices always have. `R^{-1/2} · R^{-1/2}` is `normalizedBlock · R`
  of `HCPoly/Entry/Setup/ProjectiveDistance.lean`.
* The average `⨍_{z∈Z}` is `(#Z)⁻¹ • ∑_{z∈Z}` of the conjugated centered blocks, taken in the
  `2d`-by-`2d` matrix algebra through `toFullBlockMat`/`ofFullBlockMat`: the definition layer
  names the difference and the conjugation but no block addition, and the printed average needs
  no new definition.
* `𝐀(⋄_j^q)` on the right is the cell at the origin, untranslated, exactly as printed.
* **Not carried**: the integrability of either side. The display asserts none, and the proof
  derives it from the standing assumptions ("the bounded-window estimate gives the required
  `L^N(S_N)`-integrability", `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`); under the real-valued reading a
  non-integrable moment makes the corresponding norm Mathlib's junk `0`. No `SchattenMemLp`
  premise is added here, since the manuscript prints one only in `l.fixed.geometry.positive.gap`.

The proof applies `Homogenization.HighContrast.Entry.fixed_geometry_matrix_averaging` (`HCPoly/Entry/MatrixAveraging.lean`).

/-- **Lemma `l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging`**. There is
`C_src(d,γ)` such that, for every `j_*` satisfying `e.source.lower.scale` (standing
near `e.source.lower.scale`), every even `N ≥ 2`, `q = 𝒬(𝔪)`, `j ≥ j_*`, every nonempty finite
`Z ⊆ 3^j q ℤ^d`, and every deterministic positive definite `2d`-by-`2d` matrix `R`:
