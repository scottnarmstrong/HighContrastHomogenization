# Proposition `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence` — parent--child recurrence

`p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`, the paper's Proposition "Parent--child recurrence", transcribed from
the printed display.

Reading of the display, stated here so that no divergence is silent:

* `V^q_j` is `normalizedFluctuationSelf P q j`, the diagonal fluctuation `V^q_{j,j}(0)`
  near `e.scale.selection.normalized.mean.fluctuation`, and `Δ^q_{j,j+h}` is `logDetLoss P q j (j+h)`
  (`e.scale.selection.logdet.loss`); `‖·‖_{L^N(S_N)}` is `lqSchattenNorm`, real-valued under the real-valued reading, with the even `N ≥ 2` coerced to its real Schatten index.
* `𝔪 > 0` is `Matrix.PosDef`, `q = 𝒬(𝔪)` is `Geometry.explicitRoundedGrid jStar m`, the standing
  `3^{j_*} ≥ 2d` near `e.rounded.grid.bounds` is `hj` and the standing `d ≥ 2` of `t.polynomial.entry` is `hd`.
  `j ≥ j_*` and `h ≥ 1` are the printed integer constraints.
* **The source lower scale is a standing hypothesis.** Near `e.source.lower.scale` reads "From now
  on `j_*` satisfies `e.source.lower.scale`", i.e. `j_* ≥ ⌈C_src(d,γ) log_3(2K_{Ψ_S})⌉` with
  `C_src` the constant of the source estimate (near `e.source.lower.scale`). That sentence stands from there
  onward, of the same kind as `3^{j_*} ≥ 2d` near `e.rounded.grid.bounds`: every later statement whose type
  mentions `j_*` carries it as a premise, whether or not its own display restates it, and whether
  or not its proof will use the source estimate. This display does not restate it; it is carried
  here as `hsrc`. `C_src` is existential in the outermost constant group, before the coefficient
  law and the geometry, since the manuscript fixes one such constant for the whole argument at
  `(d,γ)`; a universally quantified `C_src` would be a different, stronger claim.
* The display names no hypothesis on the coefficient law; the manuscript's standing assumptions
  are in force throughout and are carried here in the binder order of the root statement
  `HCPoly/Entry/Statements/PolynomialEntry.lean`. The proof uses stationarity and subadditivity of the coarse
  response, the range of dependence (through `l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging`), and the
  bounded-window estimate.
* **Not carried**: the `L^N(S_N)` integrability of `V^q_j` and `V^q_{j+h}`. The display asserts
  none — the printed proof derives it from the standing assumptions ("the bounded-window estimate
  gives the required `L^N(S_N)`-integrability", `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`) — and under the real-valued reading a
  non-integrable moment makes the corresponding norm Mathlib's junk `0`. The dependency graph
  records that integrability as a hypothesis of this node; the printed display does not, and the
  display governs. No `MemLqSchatten` premise is added.
* `3^{-(d/2)h}`, `(2d)^{1/N}`, `d^{1−1/N}` and `(e^{Δ}−1)^{1/N}` are real powers, as printed.

The proof is one application of `Homogenization.HighContrast.Provider.fixed_geometry_parent_child_recurrence` (`HCPoly/Entry/ParentChildRecurrence.lean`) to the binders of the statement.

/-- **Proposition `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`**.
There is `C_src(d,γ)` such that, for every `j_*` satisfying `e.source.lower.scale` (standing
near `e.source.lower.scale`), every even `N ≥ 2`, `𝔪 > 0` with `q = 𝒬(𝔪)`, and all integers
`j ≥ j_*` and `h ≥ 1`:
`‖V^q_{j+h}‖_{L^N(S_N)} ≤ N 3^{d/2}(1+(2d)^{1/N}) 3^{−dh/2} e^{Δ^q_{j,j+h}} ‖V^q_j‖_{L^N(S_N)}
