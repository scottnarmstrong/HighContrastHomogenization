# Proposition `p.successful.short.bridge` — comparison after a change of geometry

`p.successful.short.bridge`, the paper's Proposition "Comparison after a change of geometry",
transcribed from the printed display.

Reading of the display, stated here so that no divergence is silent:

* **The source lower scale is a standing hypothesis.** Near `e.source.lower.scale` reads "From now
  on `j_*` satisfies `e.source.lower.scale`", i.e. `j_* ≥ ⌈C_src(d,γ) log_3(2K_{Ψ_S})⌉` with
  `C_src` the constant of the source estimate (near `e.source.lower.scale`). That sentence stands from there
  onward, of the same kind as `3^{j_*} ≥ 2d` near `e.rounded.grid.bounds`: every later statement whose type
  mentions `j_*` carries it as a premise, whether or not its own display restates it, and whether
  or not its proof will use the source estimate. It is therefore a hypothesis here, with `C_src`
  existential in the outermost constant group, depending on `(d,γ)` only, since the manuscript
  fixes one such constant for the whole argument.
* `L_0(d,γ) ∈ ℕ` and `c_0(d,γ) ∈ (0,1)` depend on `d` and `γ` only and are bound first;
  `B_0(σ,L,d,γ) ≥ 1` depends also on `σ` and `L` and is bound after them, before the coefficient
  law and the geometry — the printed argument lists fix these scopes.
* `L ∈ ℕ` with `L ≥ L_0 + ⌈log_3(σ^{-1})⌉`; the ceiling is the ceiling into `ℤ`, and the
  comparison is made in `ℤ`.
* `𝔪, 𝔪_+ > 0` are `Matrix.PosDef`, `q = 𝒬(𝔪)` and `q_+ = 𝒬(𝔪_+)` are `Geometry.explicitRoundedGrid`,
  `Π` is `aspectRatio E`, `Q` is `bigQ d γ`, `d_pr` is `projectiveDistance`, `𝒫_q(n;k)` is
  `profile P γ q jStar k n`, `D_{q,j_*}` is `determinantDrift` and `Δ^q_{n,n+2L}` is
  `logDetLoss`. The standing `3^{j_*} ≥ 2d` near `e.rounded.grid.bounds` is `hj` and the standing `d ≥ 2`
  of `t.polynomial.entry` is `hd`.
* `⋄^q_{n+2L} ∪ ⋄^{q_+}_{n+L} ⊆ □_{2j_*}` is the printed containment, with `□_{2j_*}` the
  centered cube `HighContrast.centeredCube d (2 j_*)`.
* The conclusion `(1−σ)𝐀hom_{n+2L,q} ≤ 𝐀hom_{n+L,q_+} ≤ (1+σ)𝐀hom_{n+2L,q}` is the Loewner
  order `BlockMatLoewnerLE` of the scaled annealed blocks (`blockScale`).
* The display names no hypothesis on the coefficient law; the manuscript's standing assumptions
  are in force throughout and are carried in the binder order of the root statement
  `HCPoly/Entry/Statements/PolynomialEntry.lean`, after the constants, which the printed argument lists say
  are independent of the law.

The proof is one application of `Homogenization.HighContrast.Provider.successful_short_bridge` (`HCPoly/Entry/SuccessfulShortBridge.lean`) to the binders of the statement.

/-- **Proposition `p.successful.short.bridge`**. There are
`L_0(d,γ) ∈ ℕ` and `c_0(d,γ) ∈ (0,1)` such that for every `σ ∈ (0,1]` and `L ≥ L_0 +
⌈log_3(σ^{-1})⌉` there is `B_0(σ,L,d,γ) ≥ 1` with: under the printed containment, eccentricity,
`n ≥ k+2Q`, `d_pr([𝔪],[𝔪_+]) ≤ 1` and `𝒫_q(n;k)+D_{q,j_*}(n)+Δ^q_{n,n+2L} ≤ c_0σ`, one has
`(1−σ)𝐀hom_{n+2L,q} ≤ 𝐀hom_{n+L,q_+} ≤ (1+σ)𝐀hom_{n+2L,q}`. -/
