# Residue colouring modulo three: separation, classwise independence, the `3^{d/2}` count

The first paragraph of the printed proof
(`l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging`):

> Write `z = 3^j q w` and color the adapted cubes by the residue class of `w` modulo three.
> There are at most `3^d` classes.  Before applying `3^j q`, distinct cubes in one class are
> separated by Euclidean distance at least two.  By `e.rounded.grid.bounds`, their images have
> Euclidean separation at least `3^j`, and hence `ℓ^∞`-separation at least `3^j/√d ≥ 1`.  The
> range-of-dependence assumption therefore makes the cubes in each class jointly independent.

Every constant below depends on `d` alone; no ellipticity constant occurs.

* `exists_unique_index_of_mem_adaptedLatticeAtScale` — for `IsUnit q` every lattice centre has a unique
  integer index, so the colouring of centres by `w mod 3` is well posed.  The index map itself is
  taken proof-locally by `Classical.choose` at the use site; no production definition is added.
* `unitSeparated_adaptedCellAtCenter_of_residue_eq` — the separation, stated as the
  `UnitSeparated` of `HCPoly/Setup/LocalSigmaFields.lean`.  `Source.AKL.supDist x y = ‖x - y‖` and
  the norm of `Vec d = Fin d → ℝ` is the `ℓ^∞` norm, so this is exactly the printed
  `ℓ^∞`-separation.
* `iIndepFun_coarseBlockNormalized_of_unitSeparated` — classwise joint independence, from the
  full-matrix `iIndepFun_of_coeffSigma_measurable`, pushed through the fixed measurable map
  `M ↦ S (M - A) S`.  The full-matrix export is used, not the fixed-entry consumer, which would
  give independence one entry at a time.
* `sum_rpow_card_fiber_le` and `card_residue_colours` — the class-size estimate
  `∑_c (#C_c)^{1/2} ≤ 3^{d/2} (#Z)^{1/2}` by Cauchy-Schwarz over at most `3^d` classes.  Empty
  classes contribute `0` to both sides and are not excluded by a hypothesis.

(`Geometry.adaptedCellCenter_injective`), so colouring a centre by the residue of its index is
well posed.  The index map is produced proof-locally by `Classical.choose` on this statement. -/

/-! ## Separation inside one colour class -/

/-- **Separation.** Two distinct indices with the same residue modulo three give
`UnitSeparated` adapted cells, for `q = 𝒬(𝔪)`, `3^{j_*} ≥ 2d`, `d ≥ 2` and `j ≥ j_*`.

Route: some coordinate of `w - w'` has absolute value at least three, so the standard cells are
`ℓ^∞`-separated by more than `2·3^j`; `q ≥ ½ Id` with the symmetry of `q` contracts the Euclidean
norm by at most a factor two; and `‖·‖_∞ ≥ ‖·‖₂/√d` with `3^j ≥ 3^{j_*} ≥ 2d` closes it. -/
