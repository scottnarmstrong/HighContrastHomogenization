# A statement in CoarseGraining's own vocabulary

Stated in CoarseGraining's own vocabulary and namespace, with CG's hypotheses and no predicate
of this library, so that upstreaming is a file move.

**Why the Lean route differs from the paper's.** The paper argues through the coarse block of the
remaining set `W \ ⋃_{i≤N} U_i`, its pointwise-average bound, and local integrability. That route
needs the block on sets that are not open, which CoarseGraining does not define and nothing here
needs. The Lean
proof is direct: every `ResponseJ (U i) p q a` lies in `[0, λ⁻¹(Λ²|p|² + |q|²)]` with the
*container's* `λ, Λ` (CG's plain bound), the weights sum to at most one, so the series converges
absolutely; the inequality is then the variational argument pointwise in the test vector, exactly
CG's `intro X`. No Loewner limit is taken.

The proof applies `Homogenization.HighContrast.CG.responseJ_le_sum_volumeRatio_mul_responseJ_add_defect_of_isEllipticFieldOn_provider` (`HCPoly/Entry/CG/Proofs/ResponseFiniteDefect.lean`).

/-- **Finite family, no exhaustion: the honest finite API.** The plain finite-subfamily inequality
`A(W) ≤ Σ_{i∈F} w_i A(U_i)` is false (take `F = ∅`); what holds carries a defect — the uncovered
volume fraction times the plain pointwise bound on the response integrand. -/
