# Initialization: the canonical metric, the projective sandwich and the entry radius

The two deterministic kernels A17 and A18 of the initialization route and the entry-radius
estimate they prove (`p.initial.fixed.grid.scale`, the printed
"entry-radius estimate"; the geometric-mean monotonicity is
`p.global.selection`).  Block plumbing, the
projective-distance sandwich, and the identification of the canonical metric of a block
matrix with a matrix geometric mean are proved first.

Hermitian symmetry of `skewCorrectedForm E h` is proved here from block symmetry and the
public `posDef_lowerRight`; `HCPoly/Entry/Analysis/ReferenceComparison.lean` has no public original
for it (its `corrected_pos` proves the stronger `PosDef` privately).  The two facts that
file does export, `swapConj_lowerRight` and `schurSigma_le_corrected`, are used directly.

No probability law and no annealed premise enters any statement of this file.
