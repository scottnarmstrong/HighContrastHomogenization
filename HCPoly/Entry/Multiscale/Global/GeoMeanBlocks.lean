# Block plumbing and the projective-distance sandwich

Block-matrix plumbing for the Loewner order (`matLE_iff`, `le_of_blockMatLoewnerLE`, `toFullBlockMat_blockScale`,
the `lowerRight` transfer lemmas), the projective-distance sandwich
`projectiveDistance_le_of_sandwich`, and the identification of the canonical metric with a
matrix geometric mean. These are the helpers the public toolkit
`HCPoly.Entry.Multiscale.Initial.GeometricMean` (namespace `GeometricMean`) does not itself carry; the
square-root order and geometric-mean facts are taken from there. They supply the block-order and
matrix-geometric-mean part of the canonical-metric comparison in the finite run of
`p.global.selection`, bounding the projective distance between two canonical metrics by half the
logarithm of the Loewner sandwich ratio.
