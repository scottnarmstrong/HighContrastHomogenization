# The sharp (primal-adjoint) order layer: the hypothesis `hcmp` supplied

Nothing here restates or weakens any existing declaration, and the target
`diagonalWeakNorm_primal_le` in `HC2b_DiagonalWeakRecent.lean` is untouched.

## Why this module exists

The energy-map comparison `h6a_energy_map_congr_le` in
`HC2b_DiagonalWeakRecentEnergyMap.lean` has a shared root for two consumers, and what both
consumers still share is exactly one hypothesis: its `hcmp`, the form used here of
`diagonalMetric_le_scaled_coarseStarred_adaptedCellAtCenter`.  That hypothesis is supplied here,
and the comparison is discharged with it.

## The design decision, and why no definition is introduced

Two routes encode the same comparison.  The first transcribes an encoding through
`blockSharp`, `fullBlockSharp`, `relSize`, `blockSize`, `diagonalWeakMetricFactor`,
`metricBlockNormSq`, `adaptedResponse` and `adaptedDomainAt`: eight new definitions, all
currently zero declarations in this development.  The second expresses the comparison through
the carriers already present, and this module takes it.

**This module introduces no definition at all.**  Every declaration below is a `theorem`, so no
satisfiability obligation arises from a definition.  The two substantive hypotheses that do
carry content — positive definiteness and sharp self-duality of the reference block — are
hypotheses of theorems, and their satisfiability is nevertheless proved outright, in this module
and before the consumer statements that use them: the witness `R = M_0(F)^{1/2}` that the
consumers actually print is exhibited as an explicit `∃`.

The three encodings needed and already available:

* `fullBlockSharp H = 𝐑 H⁻¹ 𝐑` is written out as the literal product
  `toFullBlockMat (blockSwap d) * H⁻¹ * toFullBlockMat (blockSwap d)`; `blockSwap`
  (`Setup/BlockCalculus.lean`) is `Book.Ch02.blockR`, that is `fullBlockRefl`, on the nose;
* `relSize P Q = ‖matSqrt Q⁻¹ * P * matSqrt Q⁻¹‖` is definitionally
  `‖toFullBlockMat (normalizedBlock P Q)‖` (`Setup/BlockCalculus.lean`);
* `blockSharp (coarseBlockMatrix U a) = coarseStarredBlockMatrix U a`, which needs no
  positivity at all because `𝐑` is an involution.

## Two simplifications of the route

1. The sharp comparison replaces the sizes `E` against `M` and `A` against `E` by arbitrary
  positive `k` and `e` carrying only the two Loewner inequalities the proof uses.  That is
  strictly more general, and it is the shape a consumer has: consumers own bounds on the two
  sizes, not their exact values.  A separate size step recovers the exact-size instance when a
  consumer wants it.
2. The self-duality step goes through `blockMatInv_metric_eq_blockReflect`; here it is done as
  the direct `2 × 2` block computation, so that lemma is not needed.

The route below is proved directly on the carriers of this development and of `CoarseGraining`;
nothing is imported from any other development and no file is copied.

/-! ## The two-step sharp comparison -/

/-- **The sharp comparison.**  If the reference block `M` is its own sharp, then two
Loewner comparisons `E ≤ k M` and `A ≤ e E` reverse under the sharp involution into a single
comparison of `M` against the sharp of `A`:

`M ≤ (k e) · 𝐑 A⁻¹ 𝐑`.

The sizes `E` against `M` and `A` against `E` are replaced by arbitrary positive `k` and `e`
carrying only the two inequalities the proof actually uses.  That is strictly more general than
fixing those sizes, and it is the shape a consumer has: consumers carry bounds on the two sizes,
not their exact values. -/

/-! ## The relative size, on the `normalizedBlock` carrier -/

/-- **The size step.**  A block is dominated by its reference, dilated by the operator norm of
the `Q`-normalized block:

`P ≤ |Q^{-1/2} P Q^{-1/2}| · Q`.

No new definition is needed for the relative size: `toFullBlockMat (normalizedBlock P Q)`
unfolds to exactly `matSqrt Q⁻¹ * P * matSqrt Q⁻¹`, so
`‖toFullBlockMat (normalizedBlock P Q)‖` is `‖matSqrt Q⁻¹ * P * matSqrt Q⁻¹‖` on the flattened
carrier.  The proof is one observation: conjugation by `Q^{-1/2}` is a congruence sending `Q`
to `1`, and the spectral norm reads a bound against `1` off directly. -/
