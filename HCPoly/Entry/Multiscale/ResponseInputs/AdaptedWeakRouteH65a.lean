/-! ## The energy split on `{M > 1}` (`p.response.transfer`) -/

/-! ### The energy identity, the depth-0 extraction, congruence and un-normalization

The statement is dealt with in four steps.

(i) ENERGY IDENTITY.  By definition
    `ℰ_t(a)² = volumeAverage U_t (x ↦ ∇v_a(x) ⬝ b_a(x) ∇v_a(x))`.
  For a response maximizer `u` of the load `(p, q)` for `b` on `U` the identity needed is
      `volumeAverage U (∇v ⬝ b ∇v) = x ⬝ (coarseBlockMatrix U b) x - 2 (p ⬝ q)`,  `x = (-p, q)`,
  i.e. `ℰ² = 2 J = x ⬝ A(U;b) x - 2 (p ⬝ q)` with `J = ResponseJ U p q b`.  What is available
  is
    * the MEAN identity `cellAverage_optimizerField_eq_blockResponseMean`
      (`HC1_DomainBridge.lean`): the cell average of `(∇v, b∇v)` is `x + 𝐑 A(U) x`; and
    * the RESPONSE-VALUE identity `ResponseJ U p q b = ½ x ⬝ A(U) x - p⬝q`, used inside that
  proof (`HC1_DomainBridge.lean`) and exported as
      `Annealed.responseJ_eq_coarseBlock_adapted`.
  Neither says anything about the maximizer's Dirichlet ENERGY.  `CoarseGraining`'s
    `ResponseIdentities/AverageFormulas/CoarseFormulas.lean` is the only candidate and it is
    (a) only the `p = 0` case, (b) only under `IsSigmaStarCoarse`, and (c) only an inequality.
  The identity is therefore supplied below by a first-variation lemma (the Euler-Lagrange
  identity for `IsResponseMaximizer`), not by reassembling the identities above.

(ii) DEPTH-0 EXTRACTION.  The bound
    `A_t(a) ≤ (1 + M(a)) E_t` comes from `M(a) ≥ 3^{-ρ·0}·blockSpecBound(normalizedBlock (A_t(a))
  E_t - I)`, i.e. from `le_csSup` applied to the `n = 0`, `z = 0` member of the defining set of
    `respAllScaleMax` (`AdaptedDefs.lean`; `triadicIndexBox d 0 = {0}` and
    `adaptedCellAtCenter q (t-0) 0 = adaptedCell q t` are routine).  `le_csSup` needs `BddAbove` of that
  set.  Without it the `sSup` is the junk value `0` and the inequality is FALSE (take any `a`
  whose coarse blocks blow up along `n`: `M(a) = 0` while `A_t(a)` is not `≤ E_t`).  This is why
  the statement carries the qualification `∀ᵐ a ∂P`.  That `BddAbove` is derivable pathwise from
    `RawOutput` alone and with no new binder; it is proved below as `b130_pathwise_envelope` and
  consumed by `b130_coarseBlock_le_one_add_respAllScaleMax`.  The bound comes from
    `Source.bounded_source_envelope` (`HCPoly/Entry/Source/BoundedWindowFiniteness.lean`, sorry-free),
  whose only hypotheses are `IsStationaryLaw P` and `CoarseEllipticityDagger P γ E Ψ K Src` --
    `raw.stat` and `raw.ell`.  See the block below for the full argument.

(iii) CONGRUENCE.  `coarseBlockMatrix U_t (respCoeffMinus F a) = blockCongr (respG F) (coarseBlock U_t a)`
  is `coarseBlockMatrix_sub_skew_eq_blockCongr` (`AdaptedSwarm.lean`).  It consumes
    `HasQuadraticMu U_t (a.1 : CoeffField d)`, which `RawOutput` does not state: the congruence lemmas take it
  as the explicit hypothesis `hquad` (`HC1_DomainBridge.lean`).  That datum is a theorem on
  every adapted cell, `hasQuadraticMu_adaptedCell` below, whose only hypothesis
    `IsUnit (respGrid jStar F)` is itself discharged from `RawOutput` by
    `isUnit_respGrid_of_rawOutput` below, so no binder is added to the statement.

(iv) UN-NORMALIZATION.  `A_t(a) ≤ (1+M) E_t` gives, by congruence with `respG F`,
    `x ⬝ A^{b^-}_t(a) x ≤ (1+M) · x ⬝ Ehat_t^- x = (1+M) (L^-)²`
    (`h7_le_smul_of_normalizedBlock_le`, `AdaptedSwarm.lean`, and `congr_le`). -/

/-! ### The first-variation lemma and the sign of the `p·q` term

Step (i) is proved below and step (iii) is not a missing premise.

The identity is supplied by the first-variation lemma `responseJ_energy_of_isResponseMaximizer`
(`CoarseGraining/ResponseIdentities/Foundations/Ellipticity.lean`), proved there from
`basic_cg_identities_first_variation_of_isResponseMaximizer` (the Euler-Lagrange identity,
same file) and `volumeAverage_scalarResponseIntegrand_eq_firstVariation_self_add_half_energy`.  Its integrability premises are discharged by
`ResponseLinearIntegrabilityData.of_isEllipticFieldOn`
(`ResponseIdentities/Foundations/Maximizer.lean`).  This tree's `weakOptimizerEnergy`
is already the scalar energy `⨍ ∇v·b∇v`, and
`vecDot_matVecMul_symmPart` (`Ambient/CoefficientField.lean`) identifies it with
`scalarVariationEnergyIntegrand`.  The block form below is the identity
`responseJ_eq_block_quadratic_of_isOpenBoundedConvexDomain`.

SIGN RESOLUTION (the `−2p·q` vs `+2p·q` discrepancy in the block above).  Writing both sides with
this tree's actual definitions:
* `ResponseJ U p q b = ½ (−p,q)·A(U;b)(−p,q) − vecDot p q`
  (`Annealed.responseJ_eq_coarseBlock_adapted`, `HCPoly/Entry/Annealed/AdaptedDomainRecovery.lean`);
* `weakOptimizerEnergy U b u ^ 2 = 2 · ResponseJ U p q b` (step (i), below).
Eliminating `ResponseJ` gives `ℰ² = x·A(U;b)x − 2 (p·q)`, `x = (−p,q)`: exactly the identity
displayed in the block above.  The block's own gloss
"`ℰ² = 2 J + 2 p⬝q` with `J = ResponseJ U p q b`" is internally inconsistent with its own display
two lines earlier (it would force `ℰ² = x·A x`); so is the docstring's
"`ℰ_t^2 = 2J_t = x^-·A^b_t(a)x^-`".  No sign was adjusted to make a proof close: the four
theorems below are proved from the identities as stated, and the `−2 (p·q)` is what comes out.
The residual `−2 (p·q)` is harmless for the statement, whose conclusion is an upper bound: on the selected
loads `vecDot p q^∓ = 1` (`AdaptedSwarm.lean`, private but sorry-free, from
`p·q = e·e = 1` at and the skewness of `g − h_t`), so the term is `−2 ≤ 0`.

STEP (iii) IS NOT A MISSING PREMISE.  The statement is not "under-hypothesised" by
`HasQuadraticMu U_t (a.1 : CoeffField d)`: that datum is a THEOREM on every adapted
cell, `hasQuadraticMu_adaptedCell` below (re-proved from the sorry-free but `private`
`AdaptedSwarm.lean` `h7_hasQuadraticMu_adaptedCellTranslate`), and its only hypothesis
`IsUnit (respGrid jStar F)` is itself discharged from `RawOutput` by
`isUnit_respGrid_of_rawOutput` below (`raw.hj`, `raw.symm`, `raw.pos`).  So no binder is added to
the statement.

STEP (ii).  `le_csSup` on the defining set of
`respAllScaleMax` (`AdaptedDefs.lean`) needs a.e. `BddAbove` of
`{3^{−ρn} · blockSpecBound (normalizedBlock (coarseBlock (adaptedCellAtCenter q (t−n) z) a) E_t − I)}`
over all `n : ℕ` and `z ∈ triadicIndexBox d n`.  This is proved below. -/

/-! ### The pathwise envelope behind the a.e. `BddAbove`

Step (ii) is derivable with no new hypothesis.

WHERE THE BOUNDEDNESS COMES FROM.  Every cited declaration is sorry-free.

(1) `HCPoly/Entry/Source/BoundedWindowFiniteness.lean Source.bounded_source_envelope`.  For any
  BOUNDED region `W` it produces an auxiliary scale `J` and a measurable envelope `X ≥ 0` with
      `∀ᵐ a ∂P, ∀ q, InverseNormLE q 2 → ∀ j y, adaptedCellTranslate q j y ⊆ W →`
      ` coarseBlock (adaptedCellTranslate q j y) a ≤ (Cd · X a · 3^{γ·max(J−j,0)}) E`.
  Its ONLY hypotheses are `IsStationaryLaw P` and `CoarseEllipticityDagger P γ E Ψ K Src`,
  which `RawOutput` carries verbatim as `raw.stat` and `raw.ell` (`AdaptedDefs.lean`).
  It carries **no source threshold**, which is why this estimate is available here
  while the threshold estimate described below is not.
(2) The bounded region is `U_t` itself: `adaptedCell_isOpenBoundedConvexDomain`
    (`HC1_DomainBridge.lean`), and every cell of the family lies in it --
    `adaptedCellAtCenter_subset_adaptedCell` (`HC1_DomainBridge.lean`, public; the same statement
  as the `private AdaptedSwarm.lean`).  So the ellipticity constants are fixed BEFORE the
  scale index `n` is quantified.  `InverseNormLE (respGrid jStar F) 2` is
    `Geometry.inverseNormLE_roundedGrid` (`RoundedGrid.lean`) from `raw.hj` and
    `raw.symm`/`raw.pos`.
(3) The normalizer `E_t` is positive definite -- `Annealed.adaptedMean_posDef`
    (`HCPoly/Entry/Annealed/AdaptedIntegrability.lean`) -- so `E ≤ κ E_t` for SOME `κ ≥ 0` by pure
  linear algebra (`b130_exists_scale_le` below, `κ = ‖E_t^{-1/2} E E_t^{-1/2}‖`).  Only the
  EXISTENCE of `κ` is needed, never its size; that is what lets this argument avoid
    `Annealed.adaptedMean_refBlock_normalization`, whose source threshold the statement cannot discharge.
(4) The decay `3^{-ρn}` IS used: the envelope's own factor `3^{γ·max(J−j,0)}` GROWS in
  the depth `n = t − j`, and it is `ρ = (1+γ)/2 ≥ γ` (for `γ < 1`) that makes the weighted
  family bounded -- in fact bounded by its `n = 0` value.  See `b130_pathwise_envelope`.

THE THRESHOLD ESTIMATE IS NOT USED.  `AdaptedSwarm.lean`
`h5rc_pathwise_bound` feeds `respAllScaleMax_le_of_forall` a hypothesis that IS a
`BddAbove` witness, and it is already elaborated.  But it consumes `hpath` from
`Source.source_multiplier_and_adapted_bound` and `hnormt` from
`Annealed.adaptedMean_refBlock_normalization`, BOTH of which require the source threshold
`⌈Csrc_i · logb 3 (2K)⌉ ≤ j_*` for constants `Csrc_i` they themselves produce.  The all-scale
maximum bound can supply it because it *produces* `Csrc`
(`AdaptedSwarm.lean`); the statement quantifies `Csrc`
universally, so `raw.hsrc` cannot be specialised and that estimate is unavailable here WITHOUT a
statement change.  The envelope estimate needs no threshold at all.

The helpers below marked `-- transcribed:` are `private` in
`AdaptedSwarm.lean` / `HC1_DomainBridge.lean` / `HC3_CutoffKernel.lean` and are re-proved here on
this tree's carriers.  `AdaptedSwarm` IS in this
file's import closure (via `AdaptedEnergy`), but its helpers are `private`, so importing would
not have helped; **no import was added**. -/

/-! ### step (i): the maximizer energy identity.

`ℰ² = 2 J = x·A(U;b)x − 2 (p·q)`, `x = (−p, q)`.  This is the first-variation lemma; the sign
of the `p·q` term is that of the block above. -/

/-- **Step (i)**, the maximizer energy identity in the form `ℰ² = 2 J`, for a pointwise elliptic
coefficient field.  The Euler-Lagrange identity is
`responseJ_energy_of_isResponseMaximizer` (`ResponseIdentities/Foundations/Ellipticity.lean`)
on this tree's set-level carriers; the passage from
`weakOptimizerEnergy`'s integrand `∇v·b∇v` to `scalarVariationEnergyIntegrand`'s `∇v·symm(b)∇v`
is `vecDot_matVecMul_symmPart`. -/
