# The response-imbalance comparison

This file proves the response-imbalance comparison and the matrix facts behind the
calibrated-blocks estimate `e.response.calibrated.blocks`: the calibration bundle `RespCalibrated`
bounds the canonical mean, the geometric mean, and the two centred energies `Ehat^∓` of the
recentred coefficients above and below, in terms of the determinant ratio and the canonical
imbalance. It shows the calibration bundle is preserved under congruence of the canonical mean,
that the response correction `g` is skew, and that the swapped conjugate block is positive
definite, and combines these facts into the comparison between the response imbalance and the
calibration bounds. It also records that the source load `L_s^±` is a sum of squares against
nonnegative weights, hence nonnegative, and the error-row arithmetic of the cutoff estimate
`e.response.cutoff.estimate`.

/-! ## The imbalance comparison -/

/-- **The imbalance comparison** `e.response.imbalance.comparison`:
`1 <= kappa_t <= kappa_s <= r^2 kappa_t` with `1 <= r = det E_s / det E_t < e^{d sigma}`.
(`1 <= r` is `det E_t <= det E_s`, which follows from `E_t <= E_s`; it is the implicit
side condition of the printed display.)

The first inequality is `Analysis.one_le_det_adaptedMean` together with the primal-adjoint
order `Analysis.adaptedMean_swapConj_le` (`e.matrix.annealed.sharp.order`, `e.matrix.annealed.sharp.order`); the middle
one is subadditivity `Annealed.adaptedMean_antitone` and the eigenvalue-product argument of
`e.response.imbalance.comparison`; the last is `raw.det`, since
`detIncrement P q s t = log det E_s - log det E_t` by definition.

Premises `hε`, `hσ`: without them `1 ≤ B` and `jStar ≤ s` are unavailable. -/

/-! ## Helpers for the calibrated-blocks estimate

New `private` lemmas proved for `e.response.calibrated.blocks`.
They are inserted here, immediately above `response_calibrated_blocks`, so that its body can
cite them.

The route they implement: the Riccati sandwich `M(E) ≤ E ≤ 𝔡(E)^{1/2}M(E)` (`p.response.transfer`),
the self-duality `𝐑M(F)⁻¹𝐑 = M(F)` and the congruence `G^t M(F) G = M_0` , and
the two-sided comparison of canonical means that carries the cost `√(r(1+ξ)/(1-ξ))`. -/

/-- Two-sided comparison of canonical means: `A ≤ a • F` and `F ≤ b • A` give

`p.response.transfer`: the first argument of the geometric mean is monotone and
the second, `𝐑·⁻¹𝐑`, is antitone, so a two-sided comparison is what the mean consumes. -/

## Nonnegativity of the source load and the cutoff error-row arithmetic

The source load `L_s^±` of `p.response.transfer` is a weighted sum of squares against
nonnegative weights, hence nonnegative.  The cutoff estimate `e.response.cutoff.estimate`
collects its three error rows and the cutoff pairing term under one constant by elementary
arithmetic, using only that every scalar in sight is nonnegative.
