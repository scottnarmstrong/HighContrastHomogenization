# Law integrability of the recentred and adjoint pathwise response

The pathwise response `J(U_u, p, q; b)` of a sample coefficient agrees, on an adapted cell where
`b` is elliptic, with the quadratic expression `½ x · 𝐀(U_u; b) x - p · q` of the coarse block;
using the deterministic congruence linking the coarse block of a recentred coefficient to that of
the sample, this file shows that `J(U_u; a_-)`, `J(U_u; a_+)` and their squares are `P`-integrable
under the coarse ellipticity assumption. It records the square-integrability the weak-norm
estimate needs of the doubled optimizer state on an adapted cell, and the affine invariance of the
scale-average seminorm of a doubled field under a constant block change of variables. It closes
with the singular-grid branch of the cutoff-pairing bound of `e.response.cutoff.estimate`: the
relevant cell average and its integral both vanish when the selected grid is degenerate, and the
weak response energy `respWeakEnergy` is nonnegative and realized by any admissible family.

## Law integrability of the adjoint recentred pathwise response

The pathwise response `J(U, p, q; b)` of a sample coefficient is a supremum, and on an adapted
cell it agrees with the quadratic expression `½ x · 𝐀(U; b) x - p · q` of the coarse block
whenever `b` is elliptic.  This file records that agreement for the adjoint recentred
coefficient `a₊ = aᵗ + g`, where `g` is the skew Schur half of the self-dual splitting, and
deduces that the annealed response `a ↦ J(U, p, q; a₊)` is integrable for the law as soon as
the entries of the coarse block `𝐀(U; a)` are.

The two structural facts are:

* the adjoint of a coefficient reflects its coarse block in the flux slot, and recentring by
  the skew half `g` is the constant shear congruence `G` of the self-dual splitting, so
  `𝐀(U; a₊) = (G·D)ᵀ 𝐀(U; a) (G·D)`;
* the doubled quadratic form of a constant congruence is a finite linear combination of the
  entries of `𝐀(U; a)`, hence inherits their integrability.

## Law integrability of the pathwise response on an adapted cell

Let `P` be a stationary law satisfying the coarse ellipticity assumption, and let `U_u` be the
adapted cell of generation `u` on a selected grid.  This file proves that for each of the two
recentred coefficients `a_- = a - g` and `a_+ = a^t + g` of the self-dual recentring the pathwise
response `J(U_u, p, q'; a_\pm)` is `P`-integrable.

The route has three steps.  The response of an elliptic field on a bounded open convex domain is
the fixed quadratic `\tfrac12 (-p, q') \cdot \mathbf A(U; a)(-p, q') - p \cdot q'` of the coarse
block; the coarse block of a recentred field is a *deterministic* congruence of the coarse block
of the sample, so its entries are fixed linear combinations of the entries of `\mathbf A(U; a)`;
and those entries are `P`-integrable for every law satisfying the coarse ellipticity assumption.

The only dimensional hypothesis used is `d \neq 0`.

Paper: `p.response.transfer`, Step 3 and Step 6; the recentring is the one of `e.self.dual`.

## Square integrability of the recentred pathwise response

On an adapted cell the pathwise response `J(U_u; a_-(a))` of the recentred coefficient is the
fixed quadratic form `AK.HC (2.15)` of the coarse block `𝐀(U_u; a_-(a))`, and that coarse block is
a deterministic congruence `Gᵀ 𝐀(U_u; a) G` of the coarse block of the sample.  Hence the response
is an affine function of the entries of `𝐀(U_u; a)`, and the square of the response is a finite
combination of products of pairs of those entries.

This file records the two consequences used by the cutoff rows:

* each entry of `𝐀(U_u; ·)` is square integrable as soon as the coarse block lies in every
  Schatten moment `L^N(S_N)`, because the operator norm — and so each entry — is dominated by the
  Schatten norm;
* consequently the square of the pathwise response is `P`-integrable for both recentrings
  `a_- = a - g` and `a_+ = aᵗ + g`, with the Schatten-moment hypothesis discharged from the
  stationary law and the coarse ellipticity assumption.

Paper: `AK.HC (2.15)`, and the bounded-window source estimate for the Schatten moments.

## Square integrability of the doubled optimizer state on an adapted cell

The scale-average seminorm bound of `e.response.weak.estimate` is applied to the doubled
optimizer state `M_0^{1/2}\bigl((\nabla v, a\nabla v) - Y\bigr)` on an adapted cell.  Its
hypothesis is that the squared Euclidean length of that state is integrable on the cell, and
this file supplies that hypothesis.

The gradient slot is square integrable because the optimizer is an `H^1` function; the flux slot
is square integrable because the coefficient is uniformly elliptic on the cell after modification
on a null set, which is the form in which a qualitatively locally uniformly elliptic sample
provides ellipticity; the constant `Y` is square integrable because the cell has finite measure;
and a constant block matrix carries square integrable coordinates to square integrable
coordinates.

Paper: `e.response.weak.estimate`, and the normalization of the doubled state that precedes it.

## The scale-average seminorm of a recentred doubled field

The scale averages that enter the weak quantity of `e.response.weak.estimate` are the cell
averages of a doubled field after an affine change `Z \mapsto S(Z - Y)` with a constant block
matrix `S` and a constant doubled vector `Y`.  Because the cell average is linear, those averages
are the affine images of the cell averages of the field itself, so the Jensen/partition bound
applies verbatim to the recentred family.

The affine identity needs the two side conditions of an average over a cell: the cell has finite
nonzero volume, and each of the `2d` coordinates of the field is integrable on it.  Both are
supplied here from square integrability on the ambient cell.

Paper: `e.response.weak.estimate`.

## The singular-grid branch of the cutoff pairing bound

The selected grid is `respGrid jStar F = Geometry.explicitRoundedGrid jStar (explicitCanonicalMetric F)`, and
every entry of `Geometry.explicitRoundedGrid` carries a factor built from the inverse of its metric
argument.  Mathlib's matrix inverse of a singular matrix is `0`
(`Matrix.nonsing_inv_apply_not_isUnit`), so when the canonical metric is singular the selected
grid degenerates to the zero matrix and the adapted cell carries no Lebesgue volume.  This file
records those degenerations: every volume average over a degenerate adapted cell is the junk value
`0`, and the determinant of the degenerate selected grid vanishes.

## Elementary facts about the weak response energy

The weak response energy `respWeakEnergy` is the supremum, over all families of cell
maximizers of the response functional, of the weak energies
`3^{-t} ∫ [M_0^{1/2}(X_t - Y)]^2 dP`.  This file records the two facts used whenever it is
consumed as an upper bound: the supremum is nonnegative, and any single admissible family of
maximizers realizes a member of the defining set, so its weak energy lies below the supremum
once that set is bounded above.  These are the elementary parts of the weak estimate
`e.response.weak.estimate`.

## The singular-grid branch of the annealed cutoff pairing bound

The cutoff pairing of the response estimate is an expectation of absolute volume averages of an
adapted cell.  When the selected grid is singular the adapted cell is Lebesgue null, so every such
average is the junk value `0` and the expectation vanishes.  Together with the metric dichotomy
for the canonical metric, which always places an arbitrary doubled block on either the positive
definite branch or the singular-grid branch, this disposes of the branch on which the change of
variables underlying the cutoff argument is unavailable.
