# Hypotheses for the cutoff-pairing duality bound

This file assembles analytic hypotheses feeding the negative-Besov duality bound behind the
cutoff-pairing estimate `e.response.cutoff.estimate` (AK.HC Lemma A.1, (A.4)). It records that the
adapted cell is the image of the reference cube under the linear map `y ↦ q y`, so a cell average
there identifies with a cube average after this change of variables, and shows the pulled-back
cutoff gradient field `ξ` is smooth coordinatewise, uniformly bounded to second order, and
measurable. It supplies the square-integrability of the pulled-back optimizer flux under an
almost-everywhere elliptic representative, the integrability of the cutoff-weighted pairing on a
cell, and the weak solenoidality of the flux defect of an `A`-harmonic function. It also shows
that the affine defect of an `H¹` function is again `H¹` with the expected gradient, and that the
integrand of the weak quantity `W^\pm` of `e.response.weak.estimate` is almost-everywhere
strongly measurable in the coefficient sample.

## Measurability of the weak-quantity integrand of the response estimate

The weak quantity `W^\pm` of `e.response.weak.estimate` is the sample expectation of the square of
the scale-average seminorm `besovSeminorm` of the recentred, canonically-metric-scaled cell averages
of the doubled optimizer state `X_t^\pm`.  This file records that this integrand is
`AEStronglyMeasurable` in the coefficient sample.

The doubled optimizer state of an arbitrary response maximizer is determined almost everywhere on
the response cell by the Chapter-2 canonical maximizer, by a.e. gradient uniqueness for response
maximizers (AK.HC (2.9)); the canonical choice depends measurably on the sample by the Galerkin
selection construction; and the scale-average seminorm is a countable sum of finite sums of
measurable terms.  The family is summed only over the triadic index box, so its entries outside the
box may be replaced by a constant before applying the sum-measurability result.

/-- The integrand `a ↦ [M_0^{1/2} (X_t^\pm(a) - Y)]^2` of the weak quantity
`e.response.weak.estimate` is almost-everywhere strongly measurable in the coefficient sample, for
an arbitrary family of response maximizers `u`.  The cell averages entering the doubled optimizer
state are the canonically selected ones up to a null set, and the canonical selection is measurable
in the sample. -/

## The affine defect of an `H¹` function

Given an `H¹` function `u` on a bounded open convex domain `U`, a vector `P` and a
constant `c`, the affine defect `x ↦ u x - P · x - c` is again `H¹`, with gradient
`∇u - P`.  In the cutoff argument for `e.response.cutoff.estimate` the gradient
defect `∇v - P` of an optimizer is paired against a flux defect, and integration
by parts requires that this defect be the gradient of an `H¹` function: namely of
the affine defect of `v`, since the linear function `x ↦ P · x` and the constants
are `H¹` on a bounded domain and `H¹` is closed under subtraction.

## The change of variables from an adapted cell to the reference cube

The adapted cell `HighContrast.adaptedCell q t` of generation `t` is the image of the reference open
cube `openCubeSet (originCube d t)` under the linear map `y ↦ q y`
(`image_openCubeSet_originCube_eq_adaptedCell`).  This file records the two elementary facts that
let the normalized averages on the two sides be identified: the aligned cell at lattice index `0`
is the centred adapted cell, and translating the reference cube by the zero lattice index fixes it.
Together with `cubeAverage_comp_matVecMul`, these transport a normalized average on the adapted
cell to the reference cube, which is the change of variables behind the adapted-to-Euclidean
comparison, HC Lemma 2.15, (2.127)--(2.128).

## The pulled-back flux on the reference cube, with the elliptic datum packaged existentially

The two inputs below restate the square-integrability of the optimizer flux and of its pullback to
the reference cube in the form in which the cutoff argument consumes them: the coefficient is only
assumed to agree almost everywhere on the adapted cell with a field uniformly elliptic there, and
the elliptic constants and representative are introduced by an existential rather than carried as
separate hypotheses.  The a.e.-representative shape is forced by the coefficient carrier, whose
points are a.e. classes, and is enough for every `MemLp` consumer, all of which are a.e. invariant.

Paper: the cutoff estimate `e.response.cutoff.estimate` and its negative-Besov duality bound

## The flux defect of an `A`-harmonic function is solenoidal

For a set `U ⊆ ℝ^d`, a vector field is weakly solenoidal on `U` when its pairing with the
gradient of every compactly supported `H¹₀(U)` test function vanishes
(`Homogenization.IsSolenoidalOn`).  The flux `x ↦ b(x) ∇u(x)` of an `A`-harmonic function is
solenoidal by the definition of `A`-harmonicity, and a constant field is solenoidal against
`H¹₀(U)` tests because the componentwise average of a zero-trace `H¹` gradient vanishes.
Consequently the flux defect obtained by subtracting a constant vector from the flux is again
solenoidal; this is the field that the cutoff pairing of `e.response.cutoff.estimate`
(AK.HC Lemma A.1, (A.4)) pairs against.

The constant-field statement and the defect statement need integrability of the fields being
paired, which in this library is supplied by finiteness of the restricted volume measure (for the
constant) and by an explicit `L²(U)` witness (for the flux); the corresponding hypotheses appear
on the two refined statements below.

## The pulled-back cutoff gradient as an admissible weight field

For a cutoff `φ` and a matrix `qq`, the pulled-back cutoff is `ψ(y) = φ (qq · y)`.  Its gradient
field `scalarCutoffGradientField ψ` is the weight field `ξ` consumed by the negative-Besov duality
bound for the product term of the cutoff estimate (`e.response.cutoff.estimate`), which needs three
facts about `ξ`: it is smooth coordinatewise, each coordinate field has derivative bounded by the
second-derivative bound carried by the cutoff class, and `ξ` is bounded by the Lipschitz constant
of the pulled-back cutoff.  The three declarations below record exactly those facts.
