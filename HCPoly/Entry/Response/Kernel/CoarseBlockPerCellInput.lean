# The coarse-block identification and the per-cell energy-map input

This file identifies the Chapter-2 coarse-block matrix of a recentred coefficient on an aligned
adapted cell with the shear congruence of the cell's set-level coarse block, for both signs. It
reduces the diagonal weak-norm estimate's remaining analytic hypothesis to two real-arithmetic
facts, and packages its per-cell hypothesis from either a bound by fixed constants or a bound by
the metric and the cell size. It then composes the recent-difference energy map with this
bookkeeping on an aligned cell, for the recentred sample and, tracking the extra congruence the
flux flip introduces, for its adjoint twin.  It serves the weak-norm estimate
`e.response.weak.estimate`.

## The Chapter-2 coarse block of an adapted cell is the shear congruence

This module discharges the identification that the recent-difference and parent energy maps carry
as an explicit hypothesis: the Chapter-2 coarse block matrix of the recentred coefficient on an
aligned adapted cell is the shear congruence of the cell's set-level coarse block.

The two coarse-block carriers are not syntactically the same object.  Chapter 2 builds the block
from the doubled variational quantity `𝐀(U; a)` through the `sigma`/`kappa` recovery package,
while the set-level block is assembled directly from `Mu` by polarization.  The two constructions
agree on every Chapter-2 domain: Chapter-2's `doubledMu` is the set-level `Mu` of the coefficient
field (`book_doubledMu_eq_Mu`), and a block is determined by its `Mu` quadratic form
(`IsCoarseBlockMatrix` and `eq_coarseBlockMatrix_of_isCoarseBlockMatrix`).  That is the content of
`coarseBlockMatrix_domain_eq_set`.

The shear congruence itself is the set-level identity for a field recentred by a skew matrix: the
quadratic form of `a x - g` is the quadratic form of `a` at the sheared state
`(p, g p + q)`, so the recentred block is `Gᵀ 𝐀 G`.  This is `isCoarseBlockMatrix_respCoeffMinus`; the adjoint twin
`isCoarseBlockMatrix_respCoeffPlus` composes it with the flux sign flip `D = diag(Id, -Id)`.

## The analytic per-scale input, reduced to its two analytic facts

## What this file does and does not do

`recentHead_actual_le` (`DiagonalWeakNormAssembly.lean`) has exactly ONE
remaining hypothesis, its `hscale`: the analytic per-scale bound on the average-defect family.
That bound is `diagonalWeak_recent_average_bound`.

Reading the proof of that theorem, its content splits cleanly in two:

* an **algebraic spine** — per-cell bound, average, Cauchy–Schwarz-free `√` algebra — which is
  pure real arithmetic over a `Finset`; and
* two **analytic inputs**, `metricBlockNormSq_recent_difference_le` and
  `diagonalWeak_recent_difference_energy_le`, which are PDE facts about the doubled response
  space.

**This file proves the spine and states the two analytic inputs as explicit hypotheses in
this tree's own language.**  It does NOT prove those two inputs; their root
`energy_map_metric_le` rests on
`doubledResponseValue_le` / `doubledResponseValue_zero_left_eq` and
on the reflection-order layer (`blockSharp`, 444 lines plus its
`VariationalIdentities.lean` base of 323), none of which exists in this tree OR in the
`CoarseGraining` dependency.

What is gained is nonetheless the substance of the bound: after this file, the per-scale bound
is reduced to TWO named inequalities, stated on this tree's carriers, whose
conjunction discharges `hscale` mechanically.

Nothing is imported from an external development and no file is copied; the spine is stated on
this tree's inline `√(|Z|⁻¹ ∑ ⟪·,·⟫)` carrier, which is
what `weakCellSum`, `h6a_besovSeminorm_head_tail_le` and `hscale` all spell.

instantiated at exactly the shape of the remaining hypothesis `hscale`
(`recentHead_actual_le`, `DiagonalWeakNormAssembly.lean`): the index set is
`triadicIndexBox d n`, the root is `blockSqrt (respM0 F)`, and the four scalars are the printed
ones —

* `K = √(blockSpecBound (normalizedBlock Ê⁻ M₀))`, the `diagonalWeakMetricFactor m E`;
* `B = 1 + √(respAllScaleMax) · 3^{ρn/2}`, the all-scale-maximum factor;
* `L = √(respLsqMinus)`, the `diagonalWeakLoadMinus E p r`;
* `D = ‖weakAverageDefect …‖`, the `blockSize (diagonalWeakAverageDefect …) (blockIdentity d)`.

The field family `Y` is left abstract: `recentHead_actual_le` instantiates it at
`Y w = fun x => optimizerField b u x - optimizerField b (V n w) x`, which matches definitionally.

**The two hypotheses are precisely the two analytic inputs**, in this tree's language:

Neither is proved in this tree.  What this theorem establishes is that NOTHING ELSE is needed:

## The per-cell hypothesis of the per-scale input, from its two inputs

The per-scale input `scaleInput_of_analytic` consumes a per-cell hypothesis bounding the
metric square of a cell average by a fixed printed constant times a weight `G`.  The energy-map
layer delivers that bound with a different constant: a product `k * e` of two Loewner sizes.
This file is the bookkeeping that turns the second shape into the first, given the numerical
comparison between the two constants.

Both statements are monotonicity of multiplication by a nonnegative weight.  No matrix identity
is used beyond the nonnegativity of the quantities involved, and the first statement is the
generic core of the second.

/-- Monotonicity of a per-cell bound in its constant.  If `V w ≤ c₁ * G w` for every `w` in a
finite index set and the weight `G` is nonnegative there, then the same bound holds with any
larger constant `c₂`.  The nonnegativity of `c₁` is carried because the constant in the analytic
per-scale input is a product of Loewner sizes, but the monotonicity step itself needs only

## The recent-difference energy map on an aligned cell

This composes the recent-difference energy map on the doubled response space with the per-cell
bookkeeping of the weak-norm estimate.  The response-size input is taken at the square of the
printed geometric factor, and the metric factor is the operator norm of the normalized reference
block, which on positive definite carriers is the printed spectral bound.

The remaining input is the identification of the Chapter-2 coarse block with the shear
congruence of the cell's coarse block.  The two coarse-block carriers used here — the Chapter-2
`coarseBlockMatrix` on a `Domain` and the set-level `coarseBlockMatrix` on the cell — are not
identified by any declaration in this module's import closure, so that identification is carried
as an explicit hypothesis.

/-- The recent-difference energy map on an aligned cell, with the response-size factor supplied
through the shear congruence.  For every index `w` in the triadic box, the metric square of the
cell average of the doubled difference of two optimizers is bounded by the printed geometric
square times the actual difference energy on that cell.

The hypothesis `hcoarse` identifies the Chapter-2 coarse block of the recentred coefficient with
the shear congruence of the cell's coarse block; it is the shape the shear identity produces and
the one input this module cannot discharge from its own imports. -/

## The recent-difference energy map, adjoint sign, as a split proof

The energy map of `CoarseBlockPerCellInput` is stated for the recentred sample
`respEhatMinus`.  The `+` copy of the cell-average estimate needs the adjoint twin, whose sample
is `respEhatPlus = blockAdjoint (respEhatMinus …)`.  Because the adjoint adds one congruence by
the flux flip `D`, the response-size input is no longer a bound for the shear factor `respG F`
alone: it is the composed factor `D ∘ respG F`.  This file splits the port in two so that the
large block terms are elaborated once each: the per-cell step carries the two Loewner constants
abstract, and the second theorem feeds it the adjoint size inputs.

The remaining input of the second theorem is the identification of the Chapter-2 coarse block of
the recentred adjoint field with the composed congruence of the cell's coarse block; the two
coarse-block carriers used here — the Chapter-2 `coarseBlockMatrix` on a `Domain` and the set-level
`coarseBlock` on the cell — are not identified by any declaration in this module's import closure,
so that identification is carried as an explicit hypothesis, exactly as for the minus sign.
