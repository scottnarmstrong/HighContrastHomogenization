# The recent-scale decomposition, Loewner envelope and energy map

This file proves three steps of the response-transfer proposition `p.response.transfer`. The first
is the recent-scale decomposition, writing the transported recentred parent cell average as the
child average plus the parent-minus-child difference. The second is the Loewner envelope
`N ≤ ‖N‖ · I` of a doubled block by its operator norm, needed for the quadratic half of the
diagonal weak-norm estimate. The third is the coarse energy-map bound on the doubled response
space, reached through two independent chains of metric comparisons and recorded together with the
quadratic-form identities it rests on.

## The recent-scale decomposition

Nothing here restates or weakens an existing declaration, and `diagonalWeakNorm_primal_le`
(`DiagonalWeakNormBound.lean`) is untouched.

## The decomposition

Between the compiled bound (`DiagonalWeakNormAssembly.lean`) and
`diagonalWeakNorm_primal_le` lie three steps.  This file is the first: the scale decomposition.

The compiled bound is `∑_{n ≤ H} 3^{-n/2} · (cellTerm V n + A n)`, where `cellTerm V n` is built
from a per-cell CHILD maximizer `V n w` and `A n` is an abstract per-scale average-defect term.
The left-hand side of `diagonalWeakNorm_primal_le`, after the two support lemmas
(`RecentEnergyMapSupport.lean`), is the head of the seminorm of the ACTUAL
family: the same expression with the PARENT field `Xu` in place of `V n w`.  The recent-scale
decomposition is what connects them, at each depth `n` and then summed:

`headTerm n ≤ cellTerm n + defectTerm n`,

with `defectTerm n` the normalized root-mean-square of the averaged parent-minus-child
difference — i.e. it both supplies the inequality AND *exhibits the witness* for the bound's
otherwise abstract `A`.  What the bound then still assumes about that witness is the analytic
per-scale bound `hscale`, which is NOT in this file.

The proof uses the two ingredients, on these carriers:

* averaging the child/parent difference is the difference of the cell averages; here
  `cellAverage_sub`.
* the split `parent − mean = (child − mean) + (parent − child)` followed by the triangle
  inequality in the normalized `ℓ²(Z)` of block vectors; here `recentCell_split`.

Two implementation notes:

1. The difference is taken as `parent − child` from the start, so no separate sign-cancellation
  step is needed.
2. The quantity is spelled inline as `√(|Z|⁻¹ · ∑_{w ∈ Z} ⟪·,·⟫)`, matching `weakCellSum` and
   `h6a_besovSeminorm_head_tail_le`.  The triangle inequality for it is
   `normalized_blockL2_add_le` (`RecentEnergyMapSupport.lean`).

## The Loewner / operator-norm layer, on the block-matrix carrier

`L-1 … L-5`, proved here.  Nothing restates or weakens any existing declaration, and the target
`diagonalWeakNorm_primal_le` is untouched.

## Why this module exists

`quadratic_le_norm_normalizedBlock` below — the quadratic half of the estimate — needs the
Loewner envelope `N ≤ |N| · I_{2d}` of a doubled block by its operator norm.  The proof of that
step in `HCPoly/Entry/Response/Kernel/OptimizerEnergyIdentity.lean`
(`blockSpecBound_attained`) is `private` and strictly downstream of this module, so it cannot be
used here.

This module re-proves the step where it can be used: it imports only
`RecentScaleEnergyRoute`, and is imported by `CoarseBlockPerCellInput`, so it
sits strictly upstream of `WeakEstimateAssembly`.  The original declarations are neither deleted nor
made public.

## Two corrections to the diagnosis

1. The step actually needed is NOT `blockSpecBound_attained`.  That lemma concludes
   `N ≤ blockSpecBound N · I` and is about the `sInf` carrier; what is needed is the bound by
  the OPERATOR NORM, `x · N x ≤ |N| (x · x)`, for an ARBITRARY (in particular not positive
  semidefinite — the averaged defect is a difference of coarse blocks) matrix.  That is `L-1`
  and `L-2` here.
2. `blockSpecBound_attained` (`HCPoly/Entry/Response/Kernel/OptimizerEnergyIdentity.lean`) is a
   duplicate: `blockSpecBound_attained_of_loewnerLE`
   (`HCPoly/Entry/Response/Core/PathwiseFluctuationBound.lean`) is the same statement, and that
   module is upstream of this chain.  It is `private` there too, so it is equally unusable, though
   its import direction is not the obstruction.

The analogous estimate is `diagonalWeak_recent_response_quadratic_le`
(`HCPoly/Provider/Response/DiagonalWeakNormRecentQuadratic.lean`).  Nothing is imported
from it and no file is copied; the proof is reproduced on the block-matrix carriers, with its
`blockSize D (blockIdentity d)` replaced by `‖toFullBlockMat ·‖`, which is
what `weakAverageDefect` and `CH-3`'s `henergy` print.

## The coarse energy map on the doubled response space

This module proves the coarse energy-map estimate on the doubled response space together with
the intermediate steps it rests on.  The estimate is reached by two chains: one
reaches it through `metricBlockNormSq_recent_difference_le` and
`metricBlockNormSq_average_le_adaptedCellAtCenter`, and the other through
`metricBlockNormSq_blockCellAverage_diagonalWeakState_le`, which also applies
`metricBlockNormSq_average_le_adaptedCellAtCenter`.

The chain is
`doubledResponseJ_zero_left` → `doubledResponseValue_le` /
`doubledResponseValue_zero_left_eq` → `energy_map_le` → `energy_map_metric_le`, and it is
proved here in full.

The reflection order sits above this root: it supplies the comparison hypothesis `hcmp` of
the metric estimate below, and the chain below does not depend on it.  Only the single identity
`Sharp.blockVecDot_blockMatVecMul_blockScale` is needed from that layer; the same identity
already appears in `ResponseTransferSkeleton.lean`, and `E-1` proves it again here so that this
module's import edge stays at `Loewner`.

The final metric estimate is stated for an arbitrary reference block `M : BlockMat d` rather
than the self-dual diagonal metric `blockDiag m m⁻¹`.  That matrix plays no role in the proof —
it occurs only as the left-hand side of the Loewner hypothesis and inside the conclusion's
quadratic form — so taking `M` arbitrary is free, is strictly more general, and commits the
estimate to no one metric encoding.  Later layers may supply whichever of `blockDiag m m⁻¹`,
`blockSqrt (respM0 F)` or `normalizedBlock · ·` they print.
