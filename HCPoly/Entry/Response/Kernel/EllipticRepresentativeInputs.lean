# Elliptic representatives and integrability inputs

For the recentred coefficients `a_- = respCoeffMinus F a` and `a_+ = respCoeffPlus F a`, this file
produces an almost-everywhere-equal representative that is pointwise elliptic on the response
cell, and uses it to obtain `MemLp` of the pulled-back flux consumed by the cutoff-pairing bound.
It then proves, at the carriers of the diagonal weak-norm estimate, the nonnegativity of the
averaged energy density and the integrability of the doubled optimizer field and its flux, for
both signs and on both the aligned subcells and the parent cell.  These are the elliptic and
integrability inputs of the response-transfer estimate `p.response.transfer`.

## The elliptic input for the cutoff bound, and the pulled-back flux it feeds

`IsEllipticFieldOn lam Lam (adaptedCell q t) b` is a hypothesis that the cutoff bound
(`integral_abs_cutoffPairingOnCell_le_respWeak`,
`HCPoly/Entry/Response/Cutoff/ResponseTransferFromCutoffBound.lean`) does not carry and
would have to be given one, in order to reach
`MemLp flux 2 (normalizedCubeMeasure Q)` for the pulled-back flux -- the `hflux` slot of the
generic CG product bridge
`Book.Ch05.Section53.JUpperBoundWeakNorms.abs_cubeAverage_vecDot_centered_scalar_cutoff_le_scaledWeakNormProduct`.

**It does not have to be given one.**  For the two coefficients the cutoff bound actually quantifies over,
`respCoeffMinus F a` and `respCoeffPlus F a` with `a : CoeffSpace d`, the datum is DERIVABLE from
`a`'s own qualitative local uniform ellipticity (`HCPoly/Setup/CoefficientSpace.lean`) together
with the invertibility of the grid, which the cutoff bound carries through its premise
`2 * d ≤ 3 ^ jStar`.  The derivation is
`Annealed.exists_elliptic_representative_adapted` (`HCPoly/Entry/Annealed/AdaptedDomainLocality.lean`)
followed by `isEllipticFieldOn_sub_skew`/`isEllipticFieldOn_transpose_add_skew`; it is exactly the
derivation already performed inside `bddAbove_respWeakEnergySet_respCoeffMinus`
, lifted here to a reusable statement.

The shape is the a.e.-REPRESENTATIVE one -- ellipticity of some `f` with
`respCoeffMinus F a =ᵐ f` on the cell -- and not ellipticity of `respCoeffMinus F a` on the nose,
because a point of `CoeffSpace d` is an a.e. class and no representative of it is elliptic
pointwise.  This is the same shape as the `bddAbove_respWeakEnergySet` hypothesis
 and as
`CoeffSpace.exists_pointwise_coeffOn_family_aeeq`, and it is
enough for every `MemLp`/`Integrable` consumer, all of which are a.e. invariant.

## Pointwise ellipticity and integrability of the recentred field at the carriers

Every cell-average step of the diagonal weak-norm estimate moves a matrix through the cell
average of the doubled optimizer field `optimizerField b u = (∇v, b ∇v)`, so those steps ask
for two things about the recentred coefficient `b = respCoeffMinus F a` (or `b = respCoeffPlus
F a`): uniform ellipticity of `b` on the cell and integrability of both slots of the doubled
field.

Pointwise ellipticity is **not** derivable.  A point of `CoeffSpace d` is an a.e. class, while
`IsEllipticFieldOn lam Lam U b` requires `IsEllipticMatrix lam Lam (b x)` at every `x ∈ U`; an
arbitrary representative of the class may be modified on a null set and remain locally uniformly
elliptic almost everywhere, so only the a.e. shape `IsAEEllipticFieldOn lam Lam U b` is
available.  The tree carries the a.e.-representative datum for the two response coefficients,
`exists_elliptic_representative_respCoeffMinus` and `…Plus` (`EllipticRepresentativeInputs.lean`): some
field `f` pointwise elliptic on the cell and equal to `b` there almost everywhere.

This file discharges the integrability side conditions through that representative.  Integrals
are a.e. invariant, so the representative suffices.  The flux slot `x ↦ b(x) ∇u(x)` is `L²`
because the representative's flux is `L²` (`memVectorL2_matVecMul_of_isEllipticFieldOn`) and the
two agree almost everywhere; the scalar energy density `∇u · b ∇u` is the `vecDot` pairing of
two `L²` fields (`integrableOn_vecDot_of_memVectorL2`); and it is nonnegative almost everywhere
because the representative is elliptic on the cell, so the `vecDot` against its lower bound is
a.e. nonnegative and `volumeAverage` inherits that sign.
