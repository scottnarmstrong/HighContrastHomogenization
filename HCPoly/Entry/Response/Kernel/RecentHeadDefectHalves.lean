# The two halves of the recent-head defect bound

This file proves the two halves the diagonal weak-norm estimate's recent head is built from, for
the response-transfer proposition `p.response.transfer`: the `weakCellSum` half, bounding the
normalized root-mean-square of the child-optimizer mean defects by the reflected coarse-block
defect action, with the pointwise cell-defect step discharged of its metric-nondegeneracy
hypotheses; and the `weakAverageSum` half, the per-scale window sum over the good-branch
coefficient `√2 (1 + √M · 3^(ρn/2))`. Both halves record, along the way, that the branch where
the response matrix `respEhatMinus P jStar F t` is singular never occurs, since every
`diagonalWeak*`-family lemma excludes it by hypothesis.

/-! ### HELPERS.  The POINTWISE CELL-DEFECT step of the recent head:
the first of the two summands of the printed right-hand side.  The per-cell input is
`metricNormSq_blockAverage_sub_adapted_le` (`DiagonalWeakNormComparison.lean`), and
`diagonalWeak_recent_cell_bound` is the cell bound.

The identity `cellAverage_optimizerField_respCoeffMinus_sub_eq`
(`DiagonalDefectCarriers.lean`) identifies the child-minus-parent optimizer
mean difference with `R D x`, where `D` is the coarse-block defect that `weakCellDefect`
normalizes and `x = (-p, q^-)` is the response load; the reflected `M_0`
metric of that vector becomes the `M_0^{-1}` quadratic form, and the matrix comparison closes
the estimate.  The lemmas below are the links between them.

The identity `cellAverage_optimizerField_respCoeffMinus_sub_eq` and its dependency chain, plus
`blockMatVecMul_blockSwap` and `blockVecDot_blockSwap_respM0`, are public in the support file
and are used directly below. -/

`K_0 = |M_0^{-1/2} Ehat M_0^{-1/2}|`. -/

/-! ## WITHOUT THE METRIC NONDEGENERACY BINDERS.
`DiagonalDefectCarriers.lean` classifies `respM0 F` for an ARBITRARY `F`.  There are
exactly three branches, and in each of them the pointwise cell-defect bound holds with the SAME
printed constants — so the pointwise estimate can be used
with `hm` and `hM0` DISCHARGED, not assumed.  The part of the classification that concerns
`explicitCanonicalMetric` / `respM0` is settled here; the `respEhatMinus` part is NOT settled here. -/

/-- The pointwise cell-defect bound holds for
EVERY `F : BlockMat d`, with no hypothesis on `explicitCanonicalMetric F` or on `respM0 F`.
* `explicitCanonicalMetric F = 0`: `blockSqrt (respM0 F)` annihilates everything, so the left
  side is `0` and the right side is a product of nonnegative factors.
* `explicitCanonicalMetric F` a unit and `respM0 F` positive semidefinite: then `respM0 F` is positive
  DEFINITE (`Matrix.PosSemidef.posDef_iff_isUnit`) and `explicitCanonicalMetric F` is too, so this is
  literally the estimate with `hm` and `hM0`.
* `explicitCanonicalMetric F` a unit and `respM0 F` not positive semidefinite: `matSqrt` falls through
  on both `respM0 F` and its inverse, so `M_0^{1/2}` acts as the identity and the
  printed metric factor is `‖Ehat‖` itself; the bound is then the matrix comparison at `M = I`. -/

## The `weakAverageSum` half of the diagonal weak-norm bound and the nondegeneracy discharge

## The nondegeneracy discharge

In the branch where `respEhatMinus P jStar F t` is singular, the diagonal weak-norm statement
(`DiagonalWeakNormBound.lean`) is equivalent to its left-hand side being exactly `0`.
That branch is never proved: every `diagonalWeak*` lemma excludes it, by the pair
of binders `(hE : IsSymmetricBlockMat E) (hEpd : BlockPosDef E)`
(`DiagonalWeakNormPrimal.lean`), and the
only junk branch anywhere near this material — `canonFactor_exists`
(`Canonical.lean`) — carries the docstring
"the junk value on non-positive data is never used".  So the missing case is a DROPPED
HYPOTHESIS, not a missing proof.

The results below show that the dropped hypothesis is FREE at the consumers: the route's own
`RespCalibrated Cc P jStar F s t` (`CenteredEnergyIdentity.lean`) already contains
`C⁻¹ M_0 ≤ Ehat_t^±` in the Loewner order, and `RawOutput.symm`/`RawOutput.pos`
(`ResponseBlockObjects.lean`) already give `(explicitCanonicalMetric F).PosDef`, hence
`(toFullBlockMat (respM0 F)).PosDef` (`LoadMeanIdentity.lean`).  Both binders are in scope at
`respWeakEnergyOf_minus_le` (`WeakEstimateAssembly.lean`) and at
`response_weak_estimate_of_route` (`WeakEstimateAssembly.lean`) already, so no statement text
changes.  The satisfiability statement is in `∃` form.

## The `weakAverageSum` half

For the second printed summand, the estimate
`diagonalWeak_recent_average_good_le` (`DiagonalWeakNormRecentBound.lean`) feeds into
`normalized_diagonalWeak_recent_head_le` (`DiagonalWeakNormRecentHead.lean`).  Its
per-scale analytic input — the energy map `metricBlockNormSq_recent_difference_le`
(`DiagonalWeakNormRecentEnergyMap.lean`) composed with the difference-energy bound
`diagonalWeak_recent_difference_energy_le` (`DiagonalWeakNormRecentQuadratic.lean`) — has
no counterpart in this tree yet and is left as the explicit hypothesis `hscale` of
`weakAverageSum_half_le`.
Everything between that input and `weakAverageSum` is proved here:
the good-branch coefficient arithmetic `√2 (1 + √M·R) ≤ 4R` (`avCoeff_le`, cf.
`DiagonalWeakNormRecentBound.lean`), the weight identity `W · R = 3^{-(1/2-ρ/2)n}`
(`recentWeight_mul`, cf. `DiagonalWeakNormRecentHead.lean`), and the window
summation into `weakAverageSum` (`weakAverageSum_window_le`, cf.
`DiagonalWeakNormRecentHead.lean`).

CARRIER MAP (the section docstring of `DiagonalWeakNormBound.lean` is authoritative):
the source estimates use `E ↦ respEhatMinus P jStar F t`, `m ↦ respM0 F`,
`q ↦ respGrid jStar F`, `s = 1/2`, `rho = Quenched.contrastRho γ`, `delta = 1`, `k = t - n`.  The
source carriers are `ℝ≥0∞` with an
`if diagonalWeakMaximum … = ⊤ then ⊤ else …` guard; here everything is plain `ℝ`, so the guard
vanishes and the `hfinite : diagonalWeakMaximum … ≠ ⊤` binder has no counterpart at all —
`respAllScaleMax` is real-valued by construction (`ResponseBlockObjects.lean`).  The inner
size `blockSize D (blockIdentity d)` of the source carriers is this tree's
`‖toFullBlockMat D‖`
(`DiagonalDefectCarriers.lean`), which is why
`blockSize_diagonalWeakAverageDefect_nonneg`
(`DiagonalWeakNormComparison.lean`) — one of the five leaf consumers of `hEpd` — is here
just `norm_nonneg` and needs nothing.

/-- The square root inherits half the maximum's geometric weight, producing exactly the
`√M · 3^{rho n/2}` of `B`, the estimate
`sqrt_blockExcess_le_sqrt_mul_rpow_of_weighted_le` (`…/DiagonalWeakNormMaximum.lean`).
Composed with `le_mul_rpow_of_weighted_le` this is
`sqrt_blockSize_adaptedResponse_le_of_maximum_finite`
(`…/DiagonalWeakNormMaximum.lean`) up to the one non-carrier-free step named in the
section note above. -/
