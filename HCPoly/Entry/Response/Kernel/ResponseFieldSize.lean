# The size of a recentred response field

This file bounds the metric size of a doubled cell average by the cell energy, given a doubled
response field `Y` and the two size hypotheses that relate it to the normalized block: it shows
the normalized block is Hermitian, bounds it by one plus the spectral bound, and controls the
metric of the recent-scale difference by the weighted all-scale maximum. It also compares the
pointwise selection `Nonempty.some` of a response maximizer with the Chapter-2 canonical
maximizer, showing their gradients, fluxes and subcell averages of the doubled state agree almost
everywhere, and records the measurability of the resulting coefficient carriers.

The results below are the response-field size, restriction and selection steps of the
response-transfer estimate `p.response.transfer`.

## The response field of a recentred difference, and its size

`diagonalWeakNorm_primal_le` (`DiagonalWeakNormBound.lean`) is untouched: nothing here
restates, weakens or deletes any existing declaration.

## What this module supplies

The metric size of a doubled cell average is reduced to the cell energy
(`SharpOrderEnergyMap.lean`), given a doubled RESPONSE FIELD `Y` and two size
inequalities.  That reduction leaves open exactly two inputs:

1. the `Y` CONSTRUCTION for the recentred DIFFERENCE field, `isDoubledResponseField_grad_sub`;
  and
2. the RESPONSE-SIZE step, the `hsize` bound of `diagonalWeak_recent_average_bound`, fed by
   `sqrt_blockSize_adaptedResponse_le_of_maximum_finite`.

Both `isDoubledResponseField_grad_sub` and `exists_restrict_solution_adaptedCellAtCenter` are supplied
here.

## The size inputs are Loewner bounds

`blockSize`, `adaptedResponse`, `metricBlockNormSq`, `relSize` and `blockSharp` are not defined
on this tree.  The block-size inequality `blockSize A E ≤ B²` is written here as the LOEWNER
inequality `toFullBlockMat A ≤ B² • toFullBlockMat E`, which is the shape the size input `hAE`
actually takes, and `blockExcess A E` is written as the block spectral bound
`blockSpecBound (blockSub (normalizedBlock A E) (blockIdentity d))` — the quantity
`respAllScaleMax` (`ResponseBlockObjects.lean`) is already built from.  That substitution removes the
`blockSize_le_one_add_blockExcess` step altogether, and with it the
`blockSpecBound`-subadditivity obstruction recorded in
`RecentHeadDefectHalves.lean`: the recentring bound `N ≤ (1 + β) I` is read
straight off `blockMatLoewnerLE_blockScale_blockSpecBound_self` (`RecentScaleEnergyRoute.lean`), with no
operator norm anywhere.

**This module introduces exactly ONE definition, `adaptedDomainAt`, and it selects no
constant**: it is the per-`w` Chapter-2 domain whose carrier is `adaptedCellAtCenter q (t-n) w`, and
its two structure obligations are discharged inside the definition itself from
`isOpenBoundedConvexDomain_adaptedCellAtCenter` (`DiagonalDefectCarriers.lean`) and
`volume_adaptedCellAtCenter_toReal_pos` (`…:293`).  Its satisfiability is nevertheless exhibited as an
explicit `∃` before any consumer statement.  Every other declaration below is a `theorem`.

## The `cellAverage`/`averageVec` bridge is definitional

`cellAverage V X` (`ResponseBlockObjects.lean`) and the pair
`(Book.Ch02.averageVec U Y.potential, Book.Ch02.averageVec U Y.flux)` are the same term:
`volumeAverage` (CG `CoarseGraining/Definitions.lean`) and `Book.Ch02.average`
(CG `Book/Ch02/Response.lean`) have identical bodies.  Two `rfl` lemmas record this, so the
response-size step costs two lines, not a lemma.

carriers. -/

/-! ## The recentred-difference energy map on this tree's carriers -/

/-- **The recentred-difference energy map.**  The `R`-metric size of the cell average of the
doubled difference of two optimizers is controlled by the cell energy of that difference, with
constant `k · e` given the two size inputs.

Three deliberate strengthenings:

* the domain is an ARBITRARY `U : Domain d`, not `adaptedDomainAt hq k w`, so the statement
  carries no geometry at all (the child cell can be supplied when a consumer wants it);
* `diagonalWeakMetricFactor m E ^ 2 * blockSize (adaptedResponse q k w a) E` is replaced by the
  two Loewner inputs `hEM`, `hAE` with arbitrary positive `k`, `e` — a BOUND on the size, not the
  size, which is the shape a consumer owns;
* the `Solution.ofAEEq`/`exists_pointwise_coeffOn_family_aeeq` preamble is NOT reproduced: it
  moves the sample `a` to an elliptic representative `c`, and this tree already carries that move
  separately (`cellAverage_optimizerField_respCoeffMinus_eq_at`,
  `DiagonalDefectCarriers.lean`).  The statement below is at the representative, so
  the two moves compose without duplication. -/

This replaces `blockSize_le_one_add_blockExcess`, which goes through the norm and therefore needs
`blockSpecBound` subadditivity — the obstruction recorded at
`RecentHeadDefectHalves.lean`.  Here `blockMatLoewnerLE_blockScale_blockSpecBound_self`

bound on `N - I` directly and the identity is added back on quadratic forms, so no norm and no
subadditivity is used. -/

restricted to the child cell. -/

## Canonical response-maximizer selection: comparison and carrier measurability

The pointwise `Nonempty.some` used by
`ResponseCutoffEstimate.lean` is not definitionally the Chapter-2 canonical maximizer.  Nevertheless,
Chapter 2 uniqueness shows that their gradients, fluxes, and every subcell average of the doubled
state agree almost everywhere.  The second part records, on the library's actual coefficient
carrier, the smooth entry-test measurability needed by the Galerkin selection construction.
