# The Coarse-Block Toolkit for the Direct Fenchel Pairing

On a bounded open convex domain carrying a pointwise elliptic coefficient, the canonical coarse 
block is the Hessian of an infimum of averages of a nonnegative density, hence positive 
semidefinite, so its two diagonal quadratic forms are nonnegative, in particular for `a_∓ = 
respCoeff∓ F a`; this file records their sample integrability with that of their crossed 
product of square roots and the square of their sum. It records the pathwise mean identity of 
AK.HC (2.32), computing the cell average of the doubled optimizer state as `x + R 𝐀(V) x`, and 
shows every such average is measurable in the sample, since Chapter-2 gradient uniqueness 
identifies each maximizer with the canonical selection. Combining these, it proves the direct 
full-dual Fenchel pairing of AK.HC, Lemma A.1, (A.4): the cell average, paired against `Y = (P, 
Q)`, is controlled by the square root of the cell's own coarse-block energy of `Y`.  This is the
coarse-block estimate consumed by `p.response.transfer`.

## Sample integrability of the quadratic readouts of a coarse block

The cell half and the oscillation half of the cutoff-mean row of `p.response.transfer` read the
pathwise coarse block only through four scalars: the two diagonal quadratic forms against the
deterministic dual variable, their crossed product of square roots, and the square of their sum.
All four are integrable as soon as the entries of the block are, because the quadratic form is a
fixed real linear combination of the entries and the crossed product of square roots is dominated
by the arithmetic mean of the two forms.

This module records those four steps, together with the two bookkeeping facts the rows consume
about flat averages of integrable families and about domination by an absolute value.

## Positive semidefiniteness of the coarse block of a cell

On a bounded open convex domain carrying a pointwise elliptic coefficient field, the canonical
coarse block matrix is the Hessian of the minimal block energy `Mu` with prescribed doubled mean.
That energy is an infimum of averages of a nonnegative density, hence nonnegative, so the block is
positive semidefinite. In particular its two diagonal blocks — the `b` and the `S_*^{-1}` appearing
in `e.response.cutoff.estimate` — are positive semidefinite, which are the side conditions of the
direct full-dual pairing.

## Nonnegativity of the two diagonal coarse-block forms of the recentred families

The source-load head of `p.response.transfer` is the sum of the square roots of the two diagonal
coarse-block quadratic forms of the recentred coefficient on an aligned cell.  Both forms are
nonnegative because the coarse block of an elliptic coefficient is positive semidefinite.  The
recentred coefficients `a_∓ = respCoeff∓ F a` are elliptic only almost everywhere, so each
statement is proved at a pointwise elliptic representative on the aligned cell and transported
back, the coarse block being unchanged by an almost-everywhere replacement of the coefficient.

## The optimizer mean identity on an aligned subcell at an almost-everywhere elliptic coefficient

The pathwise mean identity `AK.HC (2.32)` computes the cell mean of the doubled optimizer state of
a response maximizer as `x + R 𝐀(V) x` with `x = (-p, r)` and `𝐀(V)` the coarse block of the cell.
The response coefficients of `p.response.transfer` are elliptic only almost everywhere, while the
identity is available at a pointwise elliptic coefficient.  Carrying the harmonic field along an
almost everywhere elliptic representative preserves the maximizer property and the optimizer field
up to a null set, so the identity transfers verbatim to the aligned subcell.

## Cell averages of the doubled optimizer field are measurable in the sample

The doubled optimizer field of a response maximizer for the recentred coefficients `a_-` and
`a_+` is determined, up to a null set of the response cell, by the coefficient sample alone:
Chapter-2 almost-everywhere gradient uniqueness identifies every response maximizer with the
canonical selection.  Consequently every coordinate of the cell average of the doubled optimizer
field over a measurable subcell is a measurable function of the sample, for an arbitrary family of
maximizers.  These are the subcell averages entering the weak quantity of
`e.response.weak.estimate`.

## The direct full-dual pairing of a cell average against a state

The direct Fenchel pairing of AK.HC, Lemma A.1, display (A.4): the cell average of the doubled
optimizer field, paired across its two slots with a state `Y = (P, Q)`, is controlled by the square
root of the cell's own coarse-block energy of `Y` — read through the two diagonal blocks of the
coarse block, `b` in the gradient slot and `S_*^{-1}` in the flux slot, exactly the two blocks from
which the source load `L_s^{±}` is built — times the square root of the pathwise symmetric energy of
the field.  The pairing is `Y.2` against the cell-average gradient plus `Y.1` against the
cell-average flux, the full-dual form consumed by the cutoff-mean rows.
