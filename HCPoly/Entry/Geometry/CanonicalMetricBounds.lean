# Positivity of the canonical metric

This proves positive definiteness of the closed printed definition of
`explicitCanonicalMetric`; it does not introduce a geometric-mean characterization or
the metric-loss estimate, which belong to the global selection.  The positivity of the
canonical metric, and its specialization to the rounded adapted means, underlies the
projective-distance geometry serving `p.global.selection` and `p.scale.selection`.

/-! ## The unconditional dichotomy

Everything above carries the printed hypotheses `hsymm`/`hpos`.  The block below carries
none.  `matSqrt` takes the junk value `1` -- not `0` -- off the positive semidefinite data
(`HCPoly/Setup/BlockAlgebra.lean`, `matSqrt`), so every factor of the closed expression defining
`explicitCanonicalMetric` is positive semidefinite whatever `F` is; a congruence, a principal
submatrix and Mathlib's `Matrix.inv` (which is `0` off the units) all preserve that.  Hence
`explicitCanonicalMetric F` is positive semidefinite for **every** `F`, so it is either positive
definite or singular, and in the singular case the rounded grid built from it collapses to
the zero matrix.  That dichotomy is what lets the response cutoff kernel dispose of the
degenerate branch without adding a hypothesis to its statement. -/

/-- `matSqrt` is positive semidefinite on **every** input: on positive semidefinite data it is
the canonical square root, and off that data it is the junk value `1`.  Stated in the
