# The root certificate, instantiated

`GoodScale` is instantiated at the **row-retaining printed-order certificate**:
the printed-order rate-bearing certificate at the common affine scale, carrying
alongside it the physical block row that produced it.  That row is exactly what
the Dirichlet provider consumes and what no producer supplied.

With this instantiation the root's `hhomogenized` hypothesis is **proved**, not
assumed — at the enlarged scale forced by the common affine multiplier, whose
law-free amplitude and eccentricity power are the `Lcert`, `pCert` the restated
interface exports.

The certificate rate is `min (kappa / 2) ((1 + g) / 4)`: the printed conversion
halves the quenched row rate, and the frozen order window
`s₀ ∈ Ico ((1+g)/4) (1/2)` caps the Dirichlet exponent at `(1+g)/4`.  Both the
certificate and the row are downward closed in the rate, so the minimum is
available.

/-- **The root certificate.**  The printed-order rate-bearing certificate at the
common affine scale, with the producing physical block row retained, and with
the row's own amplitude window `delta ∈ Ioo 0 1` exposed — the Dirichlet
provider reads `√delta ≤ 1` off it, and the row-retaining structure carries only
`0 ≤ delta`. -/
