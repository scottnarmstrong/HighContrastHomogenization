# The scheduled localization hypothesis from a ruled Whitney row supply

The scheduled localization clause consumes the scheduled localization
hypothesis: on the gauge-reduced domain it asks for a ruled scheduled
localization package together
with the two normalized Whitney row-energy caps of the corrector difference and
of the flux defect.

This module discharges every part of that demand which does not require a new
estimate — the gauge-reduced geometry, the elliptic source representative, the
Hardy coefficient, the distortion factor, the boundary energy, and the whole
package assembly — and isolates what remains as a single named supply,
`ScheduledLocalizationRowSupply`, stated at exactly the scheduled spelling.
