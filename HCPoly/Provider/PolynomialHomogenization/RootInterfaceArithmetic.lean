# Arithmetic reconciliation for the homogenization root

The root statement carries one polynomial exponent and one error exponent that
several clauses share.  Every occurrence of the constant is weakened by
enlarging it and every occurrence of the error exponent is weakened by
shrinking it, so providers producing different values can be reconciled by a
maximum and a minimum.  This module records the four comparisons that make
that reconciliation legal.

The block-to-matrix identification is no longer an arithmetic gap: the root
retains the annealed sandwich and contrast decay until the canonical block is
identified.  The quenched side likewise retains the source burn bound.  The
finite enlargement of the normalized reference family is part of the
`GoodScale` certificate, so it neither changes the real random scale nor adds
an arithmetic weakening to the frozen conclusion.
