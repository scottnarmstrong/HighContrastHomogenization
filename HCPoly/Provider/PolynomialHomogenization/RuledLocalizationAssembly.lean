# Assembly of the ruled localization provider

This module couples one ruled Whitney carrier, one buffered comparison
realization, the positive Hardy row, and the print-order rate certificate.
The comparison realization and its finite quantitative schedule are retained
as a named selected-instance trace; no datum or Caccioppoli premise is
strengthened to every carrier or every comparison family.

The numerical endpoint below is the common cap for the two realized rows.
Its coefficient is selected before the stochastic exponent, and that exponent
is selected before the comparison matrix, coefficient sample, and domain.
