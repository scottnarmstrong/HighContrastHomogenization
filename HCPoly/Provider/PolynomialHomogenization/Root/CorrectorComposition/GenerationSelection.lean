# the large-scale C¹ slope approximation clause (b2), third step: the generation selection, log-free

What remains for `ExactRootGaugeTerminal` is to match the terminal's
continuous radii `r ∈ Icc rStart R` to the cube row's generations
`q ∈ Finset.Icc n m`, with `Quenched.triadicCeilingIndex x ≤ n` and `n + 2 ≤ m`.

This is bookkeeping, but carrying it out uncovers one structural fact worth
recording, and it is not the one the rounded template suggests:

* the case split is on **`r` against `R / (108 √d)`**, not on `R` against
  `rStart`.  Above that threshold the canonical outer cube of `r` overshoots the
  inner cube of `R` — `3 ^ q(r)` is only `< 12 r`, while `3 ^ m` is only
  `> R / (3 √d)` — so the cube row does not apply there, **at any `R`**.  That
  band is exactly what the near-terminal branch must cover, and
  `r / R > 1 / (108 √d)` is what makes that branch law-free;
* the row's `n + 2 ≤ m` is then automatic on the far branch, because
  `3 ^ m ≥ 36 · rStart > 3 ^ (n + 1)`.

Everything below is comparison of triadic powers: **no logarithm monotonicity,
no measure theory, and no estimate.**  `outerTriadicGeneration` is used only
through its two scale bounds.

canonical outer cube at a generation in `Icc n m`, and the gap `n + 2 ≤ m` holds
as soon as `rStart` is below that threshold too. -/
