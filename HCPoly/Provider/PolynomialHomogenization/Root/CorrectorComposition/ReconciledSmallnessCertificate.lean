# The reconciled-smallness certificate: the assembly at the reconciled
# corrector smallness

The restated assembly `RootInterface.polynomial_homogenization_of_quenched_scale_v2`
takes `GoodScale` as a **parameter bound before `g`**.  The the ceiling-exporting smallness interface ceiling
therefore cannot be a constant chosen after `g` — but it can be `cStar g` for a
function `cStar : ℝ → ℝ` bound before `GoodScale`.  That is what
`reconciledRootGoodScale` is.

`hhomogenized` is then **proved** at this certificate, character for character
in the assembly's binder shape, checked by the partial application below,
which supplies `hquenched` and `hhomogenized` and leaves exactly the six
clauses.
