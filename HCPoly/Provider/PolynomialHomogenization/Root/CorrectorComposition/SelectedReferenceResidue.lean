# The selected-reference residue, reduced to one pointwise identity

The corrector-family hypothesis `RootPushCanonicalFamily` of the decay and
Liouville clauses reduces to a selected-reference identity, a conjunction of

1. a **pointwise** normalized-root coefficient identity for the *selected*
   corrector datum's reference family, on every triadic cube; and
2. a **natural delay** `∃ L : ℕ, (selected …).start ≤ triadicCeilingIndex x + L`.

Clause 2 is free: it is the statement that an integer is below `k + L` for some
natural `L`, which the Archimedean property of `ℤ` settles.  This module proves
that, so the residue is clause 1 **alone** — a single pointwise coefficient
identity, with no delay, no order, no tolerance and no estimate.

## Why clause 1 is not provable in this form, and what the minimal repair is

The obstruction is a data-structure defect, not an analytic gap, and it is worth
recording exactly.

* `Root.RootCorrectorEvent d b` is `Nonempty (RootCorrectorData d b)` and
  `Root.selectedRootCorrectorData b h` is `Classical.choice h`.  So the
  selected family `aFin` is an **arbitrary** inhabitant of the datum type.
* `RootCorrectorData`'s coefficient field is
  `coeff : ∀ q : ℕ, Book.Ch03.publicCoeffField (originCube d q) aFin
     =ᵐ[volume.restrict (localGradientCube d q)] ⇑b.1`
  — almost-everywhere, on **origin** cubes only, and against `publicCoeffField`.
  Clause 1 asks for a **pointwise** identity, on **every** triadic cube, against
  `(aFin.coeffOn Q).toCoeffField`.  Neither weakening of the datum's field
  yields it, so clause 1 cannot be derived from the datum type.
* The identity nevertheless **exists and is already proved** upstream.  The
  converter
  `exists_shiftedNormalizedReferencePowerTail_of_hasAllLaterPhysicalBlockRow`
  returns exactly
  `∀ Q : TriadicCube d, (aRef.coeffOn Q).toCoeffField =
      affineCoefficient (Selection.normalizedRoot (symmPart abar)) _
        ⇑(normalizedCenteredCoeff a abar hS).1`,
  pointwise and on every cube; the stationary corrector family clause's supply route consumes that witness
  and then **discards the identity** when it packages `aRef` through
  `rootCorrectorEvent_of_goodTail`, keeping only the a.e. `coeff` field.

**Minimal repair (an interface item for the stationary corrector family clause module, not applied here):** index
the corrector datum by the exact coefficient field it represents — add
`exactField : CoeffField d` together with
`coeffExact : ∀ Q, (aFin.coeffOn Q).toCoeffField = exactField` to
`RootCorrectorData`, and pin the exact field in `RootCorrectorEvent`'s index rather
than leaving it to `Classical.choice`.  The single constructor
`rootCorrectorEvent_of_goodTail` then gains one hypothesis, which the supply
site discharges **directly** with the converter's own witness.  Adding the field
without pinning the index does *not* work: two data with a.e.-equal exact fields
are both inhabitants, and the choice may return either.

Nothing in this file assumes clause 1.  It is carried as a named hypothesis.
