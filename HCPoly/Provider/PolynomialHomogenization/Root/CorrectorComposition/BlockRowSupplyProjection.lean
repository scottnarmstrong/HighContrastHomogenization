# `RootBlockRowSupply` against the ceiling-exporting smallness interface — what is carried and
what is not

The stationary corrector family clause reduces to

```lean
def RootBlockRowSupply (d : ℕ) [NeZero d]
    (GoodScale : Mat d → CoeffSpace d → ℝ → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ (abar : Mat d), (symmPart abar).PosDef →
    ∀ (a : CoeffSpace d) (x : ℝ), GoodScale abar a x →
      ∃ (Omega : Set (CoeffSpace d)) (s rho kappa delta : ℝ)
        (S X : CoeffSpace d → ℝ),
        a ∈ Omega ∧
        (∀ z : Fin d → ℤ, translateCoeff z ⁻¹' Omega = Omega) ∧
        0 < s ∧ s < 1 / 2 ∧
        0 < rho ∧ rho ≤ 1 ∧ rho < 2 * s ∧
        0 < kappa ∧ 0 ≤ delta ∧
        ∀ b ∈ Omega, 1 ≤ X b ∧ S b ≤ X b ∧

```

(order-free form: the order `s` is supplied here, not frozen upstream; the
statement is restated below rather than imported, because importing it would
pull in the whole normalized-supply chain at the free order.)

## What `rootGoodScaleAt` literally carries

Destructuring `rootGoodScaleAt d g c kappaRate abar a x` gives
`h : RowSupply.RowRetainingPrintOrderGoodScale d g c kappaRate abar a x`, and
that structure carries, **for the sample `a` only**:

| demanded field | carried by | status |
|---|---|---|
| `rho` | `Certificate.printRowOrder g = (1 + 3 * g) / 4` | ✓ |
| `0 < rho ∧ rho ≤ 1` | `g ∈ Ico 0 1` arithmetic | ✓ |
| `kappa` and `0 < kappa` | `2 * kappaRate`, positive from the hole's own `0 < κ` | ✓ |
| `delta`, `0 ≤ delta` | `h.delta`, `h.delta_nonneg` | ✓ |
| `S`, `X` | `h.sourceScale`, `h.activationScale` | ✓ |
| `1 ≤ X a`, `S a ≤ X a` | `h.activation_one`, `h.source_le_activation` | ✓ **at `a`** |
| the row at `a` | `h.row`, at `Book.Ch02.constantBlockMatrix abar` | ✓ **at `a`** |
| `s` with `0 < s < 1/2` and `rho < 2 * s` | the printed order `(1 + g) / 4`, chosen after `g` | ✓ |
| `Omega` with `∀ z, translateCoeff z ⁻¹' Omega = Omega`, `a ∈ Omega`, and the row **at every `b ∈ Omega`** | — | ✗ **the missing field** |

**The single missing field is the translation-invariant event.**  The
certificate is a per-sample predicate: it carries the row at `a` and at no other
sample.  The demanded `Omega` exists — it is `hquenched`'s `OmegaEnd`, which
carries `MeasurableSet`, `P.real = 1`, the literal
`∀ z, translateCoeff z ⁻¹' OmegaEnd = OmegaEnd`, and
`∀ a ∈ OmegaEnd, HasAllLaterPhysicalBlockRow ((1 + 3 * g) / 4) kappa delta Abar S X a`
— but `hhomogenized`'s binder surface applies **one sample at a time**
(`… (a : CoeffSpace d), HasAllLaterPhysicalBlockRow … S X a → 1 ≤ X a →
S a ≤ X a → GoodScale g kappaRate abar a …`), so the event is discarded before
`GoodScale` is formed.  No choice of `Omega` repairs this downstream:
`Omega = {a}` is not translation invariant, `Omega = univ` does not carry the
row, and the orbit of `a` carries the row only if the row is already known at
every integer translate — which is the demand itself.

**The second missing field was an order window, not a datum — and it is now
gone.**  At the stationary corrector family clause's frozen `rootCorrectorOrder = 3/16` the window
`rho < 2 * rootCorrectorOrder` read `(1 + 3 * g) / 4 < 3 / 8`, i.e. `g < 1/6`
(still proved below, as the record of what the frozen order cost).  The
corrector datum records its order as a *field* rather than reading a
global constant, so the supply chooses the order **after `g`**, at the printed
`(1 + g) / 4`; the corrector cone `s < 1/2` and the window `rho < 2 * s` are
then *both* equivalent to `g < 1`, and the admitted range is the whole of
`Ico 0 1`.

## The repair, machine-checked: the event-retaining certificate

Widen the certificate by the event and widen `hhomogenized` correspondingly.
Both directions are proved here:

* the event-level supply theorem — the event-retaining certificate discharges
  `RootBlockRowSupply` outright (given the window);
* `exists_rootGoodScaleOn_of_quenchedEventRow` — `hhomogenized` still holds at
  the event-retaining certificate, from **exactly the data `hquenched`
  already produces**, with no new hypothesis.

So the event-retaining certificate is a pure binder-surface change to `hhomogenized`: replace its
per-sample row premise by the event-level one that the assembly already has in
hand at the point of application.

/-! ### The per-`g` order, and the exact admitted range

The order the supply chooses is the **printed certificate order**
`HighContrast.printCertificateOrder g = (1 + g) / 4`, selected *after* `g`.  At
that order the two constraints the supply must meet — the corrector cone
`0 < s < 1/2` and the window `printRowOrder g < 2 * s` — are **both equivalent
to `g < 1`**, so the admitted range is exactly `Ico 0 1`: the whole root range,
and nothing is admitted beyond it. -/
