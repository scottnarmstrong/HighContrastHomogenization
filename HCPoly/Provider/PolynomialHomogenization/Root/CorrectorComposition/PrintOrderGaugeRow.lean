# The printed-order exact-gauge simultaneous-slope row

Closing the large-scale C¹ slope approximation clause directly meets four enumerated obstructions:

1. the only quantitative tail the corrector-decay layer exports is at `printCertificateOrder g`;
2. the simultaneous-slope C1 theorem required its order `< 1 / 12`;
3. the printed certificate order is not below `1 / 12`, which refutes (1)
   against (2);
4. the private-order datum in `CanonicalPullbackCorrectorFamily` is only a
   qualitative summable tail whose delay `L` and restart `n'` are selected
   *after* the sample `(a, x)`.

After the corrector cone is lifted to the printed window `s < 1 / 2`
and the fourteen order binders are
lifted with it, obstruction (2) disappears and with it (3).  This module then
removes (4) as well: the certificate's **own** print-order power tail converts
to a good tail whose start is `Quenched.triadicCeilingIndex x` with **no**
delay and **no** restart, so the C1 constants can be selected before the
sample.

The price is exactly the ceiling-exporting smallness interface root-interface ceiling: the
corrector smallness `c` must be at most a law-free `cMax` fixed by `(d, g, eta)`.
