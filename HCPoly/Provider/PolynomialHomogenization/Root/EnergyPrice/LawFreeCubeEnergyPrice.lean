# A law-free coarse-grained Dirichlet energy price on one triadic cube

The attainability route uses the `e.cg.RHS` mechanism: the energy
of a Dirichlet solution is priced by the boundary datum's fractional norm with
*coarse-grained* ellipticity constants.  This file isolates the exact reason
that price can be law-free.

`poincareUpperEllipticityFactor Q a s (.finite 2)` is `Λ_{s,2}(Q;a)^{1/2}`,
and `Λ_{s,2}` is built only from the coarse-grained block matrix `b(R;a)` —
a variational response average — never from a pointwise essential supremum of
`a`.  Upstream's
`inv_mul_LambdaSq_finite_two_le_card_mul_homogenizationError_sq_add_one`
prices it by the identity-referenced multiscale homogenization error.  Hence
*a single scalar hypothesis, `𝓔 ≤ 1`, converts the whole ellipticity window
into a dimension-only constant*, and the resulting Dirichlet energy price
depends on nothing but `d` and the fractional order `s`.

## The order at which the error is read

The certificate is a `ScalarIdentityPowerTail` at
`printCertificateOrder g = (1 + g) / 4`, while the price needs the
identity-referenced error at the consumer's own order
`s ∈ Set.Ico ((1 + g) / 4) (1 / 2)`.  That direction is the available one: the
multiscale error is decreasing in the fractional order, because the geometric weight
concentrates on the coarse scales as `s` grows, and
`homogenizationErrorOnCube_infinity_two_le_of_lt` supplies the comparison with loss
exactly one.

Combined with the target reduction — above the common affine scale the retained
amplitude is below `correctorTargetAmplitude c κ = (c / 2) * (1 - 3 ^ (-κ))`, which
is less than one — this yields the single scalar hypothesis `𝓔 ≤ 1` that the price
below consumes.
