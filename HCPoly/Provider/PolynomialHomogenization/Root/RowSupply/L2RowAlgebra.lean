# Normalized `L²` algebra for ruled Whitney rows

Every physical full-dual Whitney cell energy is priced by the normalized `L²`
average of its own field on the same cell.  That
bridge is *linear in the field on the left and quadratic on the right*, so a
pointwise splitting `H = F + G` of a cell-indexed family costs a factor two at
the level of normalized `L²` cell averages and therefore a factor two at the
level of normalized rows — no dual-norm triangle inequality is needed, and none
is available: `cubeBesovDualFullNorm` is a `sSup` whose value set is bounded
above only under `MemLp` hypotheses.

This module collects
* additivity, scalar homogeneity and monotonicity of `normalizedWhitneyRowEnergy`;
* the same three for the `L²`-priced cell energy of unit 28;
* the pointwise `L²` splitting `⨍|F+G|² ≤ 2⨍|F|² + 2⨍|G|²` on a cube; and
* the resulting **row join**: a family that splits pointwise into two families
  with priced normalized `L²` cell averages has its full-dual row under twice
  the sum of the two priced rows.
