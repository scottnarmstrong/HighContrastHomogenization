# The inner-ellipsoid normalization premise

The Dirichlet conjunct already bounds the domain above by its adapted
ellipsoid.  This file studies the effect of bounding it below by a concentric
adapted ellipsoid of an explicit dimensional radius.

Two facts are proved.  First, the class of domains satisfying both bounds is
non-empty at every dimension and every comparison matrix: an adapted cell of a
suitable generation fits between the two ellipsoids, so the proposed premise is
not vacuous.  Second, the lower bound forces the absolute gauge scale to be
majorized by the outer sandwich radius, which is exactly the majorization a
cell-anchored response rate needs in order to expose only the frozen outer
data.

/-! ## The absorption: the inner ellipsoid majorizes the gauge scale -/

/-- A concentric adapted ellipsoid inside the domain forces the absolute gauge
scale, times the ellipsoid's radius, below the outer sandwich radius of the
gauge domain.  This is the exact inequality that removes the absolute
reference scale from a cell-anchored response constant. -/
