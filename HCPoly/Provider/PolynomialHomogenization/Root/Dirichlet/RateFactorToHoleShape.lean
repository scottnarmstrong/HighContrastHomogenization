# The rate factor, from the capstone's shape to the hole's

that module concludes at the capstone's own length `x · eccentricityFoldFactor abar p₀`
and at whatever constant the caller supplies.  The clause reads its rate factor
at `x · (Lg · eccentricityFoldFactor abar pEcc)` with a **law-free** constant.

the `constant_and_eccentricity_absorbed` premise performs the two absorptions; this
module wraps it for the `ℝ≥0∞`-valued conclusion, so that a real-valued class
split of the capstone's constant (module that module) is all the caller has to supply.
