# The amplitude rate, re-derived from the provider's exports

The formulaic anchored provider transports the physical block row through an
exact triadic dilation before the response aggregation, and the transported
amplitude already contains the requested physical-frame power.  That step is
performed inside the provider's proof but is not exported, so a parallel
provider that consumes the exported package rather than the internal proof has
to re-derive it.  It is re-derived here from exactly three exported conjuncts —
the dilation identity for the microscopic parameter, its residual window, and
the definition of the transported amplitude — together with the certificate's
own structure fields.

No hypothesis beyond the provider's own binder surface is introduced.

/-- **The transported amplitude carries the physical frame rate.**  From the
exported dilation identity `lambda = epsilon * 3 ^ N`, its residual window and
the exported definition of the transported amplitude, the square root of the
transported amplitude is below the certificate's own amplitude times the
physical frame rate at the unfolded length. -/
