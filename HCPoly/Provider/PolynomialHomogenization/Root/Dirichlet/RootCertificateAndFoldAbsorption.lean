# (iii) the certificate surface, and the `Lg`/`pEcc` double absorptions

**(iii).**  `RootInterface.RootGoodScale.provider_surface` hands the Dirichlet
provider everything the certificate side of the module asks for.  Two of its
eight conclusions are the ones no other module supplies: the positive-definiteness
of `symmPart abar`, and the retained row's amplitude window
`delta ∈ Ioo 0 1` — from which `√δ ≤ 1`, the hypothesis the module needs to
drop the certificate amplitude out of the flux constant.
The Dirichlet-surface packaging supplies exactly those.

**The double absorptions.**  The module proves the frozen conclusion at the capstone's
own length `x * eccentricityFoldFactor abar p₀` and at whatever constant the
caller passes.  The clause wants it at `x * (Lg * eccentricityFoldFactor abar pEcc)`
with `C₀` **law-free**.  The two moves that get there are already separately — that module absorptions a law-free residual `Krest` into the length factor at
the rate `κ`, and that module absorptions an eccentricity power into the fold exponent — and
`constant_and_eccentricity_absorbed` performs them in one step, with

```
Lg   := perGLengthFactor Krest κ ,      pEcc := p₀ + p / κ .
```

That is the dispatch's "`pEcc` := the sum of the rate-leg and energy-leg
exponents": `p₀` is the rate leg (`foldedFrameEccentricityExponent g κ`), and
`p / κ` is the energy leg together with the output factor's `(d+1)/2`, divided
by `κ` because the rate factor takes the `κ`-th power.

/-- **The `Lg`/`pEcc` double absorptions.**  A law-free residual constant and an
eccentricity power standing beside the law-free head are absorbed, the first
into the per-`g` length factor and the second into the fold exponent, leaving
the head alone in front of the clause's rate factor. -/
