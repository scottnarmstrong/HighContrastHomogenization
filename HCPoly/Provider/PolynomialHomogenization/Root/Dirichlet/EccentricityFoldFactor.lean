# Folding the homogenized eccentricity into the homogenization length

The reference text's homogenization length carries the aspect ratio of the
homogenized matrix: the estimate with a law-free amplitude is read above a
length that has been enlarged by the corresponding root.  Replacing the
homogenization length `X` by `X * G`, the polynomial length `Lpoly` by
`Lpoly * G` and the length constant by a correspondingly larger one, for a
common positive factor `G` determined by the homogenized matrix, leaves every
clause of the statement valid: the exceedance event is literally unchanged
because the common factor cancels on both sides of its threshold, the length
bound survives because the factor is itself polynomial in the reference datum,
and each remaining clause is weakened, its premise being harder to satisfy and
its right-hand side larger.

This file proves those clause transfers, and the bound on the fold factor built
from the eccentricity of the homogenized matrix.

/-! ## The fold factor -/

/-- The witness eccentricity is a square root, hence nonnegative. -/

/-- The fold factor attached to a homogenized matrix: a power of its witness
eccentricity, read at least one. -/

theorem rpow_le_eccentricityFoldFactor (abar : Mat d) (p : ℝ) :
    witnessEccentricity (symmPart abar) ^ p ≤ eccentricityFoldFactor abar p :=
  le_max_right _ _

/-- **The fold factor is polynomial in the reference datum.**  With the law-level
eccentricity bound, the fold factor is below the printed polynomial length base
raised to a law-free exponent. -/

/-! ## The polynomial length clause -/

/-- The polynomial length bound survives the fold: the product of a length below
`base ^ C` and a factor below `base ^ C'` is below `base ^ (C + C')`. -/
theorem mul_le_rpow_add {base Lpoly G C C' : ℝ}
    (hbase : 1 ≤ base) (hG : 0 ≤ G)

/-! ## The exceedance event -/

/-- **The exceedance event is unchanged by the fold.**  Multiplying both the
polynomial length and the homogenization length by the same positive factor
leaves the threshold event fixed, so the two-part tail bound transfers after the
length constant is enlarged. -/

/-! ## The remaining clauses -/

/-- **The corrector decay factor is larger at the folded length.**  Its base is a
ratio with the homogenization length in the denominator and a negative exponent,
so enlarging the length enlarges the factor. -/
theorem corrector_factor_mono {r x x' kappa : ℝ}
    (hx : 0 < x) (hxx : x ≤ x') (hr : 0 < r) (hkappa : 0 < kappa) :
    (r / x) ^ (-kappa) ≤ (r / x') ^ (-kappa) := by
  have hx' : (0 : ℝ) < x' := lt_of_lt_of_le hx hxx
  have h1 : (0 : ℝ) < r / x := div_pos hr hx
  have h2 : (0 : ℝ) < r / x' := div_pos hr hx'
  exact (Real.rpow_le_rpow_iff_of_neg h1 h2 (neg_neg_of_pos hkappa)).2
    (div_le_div_of_nonneg_left hr.le hx hxx)

/-- **The regularity radius window shrinks under the fold.**  The frozen
Lipschitz and `C¹` clauses quantify over radii above the homogenization length,
so the folded window is contained in the unfolded one. -/
theorem Icc_foldedScale_subset {x x' R : ℝ} (hxx : x ≤ x') :
    Set.Icc x' R ⊆ Set.Icc x R :=
  Set.Icc_subset_Icc_left hxx
