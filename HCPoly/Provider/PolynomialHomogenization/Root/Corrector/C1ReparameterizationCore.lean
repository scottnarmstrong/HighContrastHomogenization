# Finite-to-limit reparameterization core

The analytic construction of the corrector parameter map is separate from
the two general steps recorded here: a uniform finite-tail estimate passes
to its norm limit, and a linear endomorphism strictly closer than the identity
is bijective in finite dimension.
