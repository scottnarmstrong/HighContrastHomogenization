# The normalized-gauge supply, from the certificate's own block row

The stationary corrector family clause reduces to `RootNormalizedSupply`.  This module
supplies it from the **same physical block row that `hhomogenized` consumes**,
through the available converter
`exists_shiftedNormalizedReferencePowerTail_of_hasAllLaterPhysicalBlockRow`.

Three things make the reduction work, and each is worth naming.

* **The gauge matches.**  The converter's reference family satisfies
  `(aRef.coeffOn Q).toCoeffField = affineCoefficient (Selection.normalizedRoot (symmPart abar)) _ ↑↑(normalizedCenteredCoeff a abar hS)`,
  which is **definitionally** `gaugeCoeff a abar hS` — the two sides are the
  same `affineCoefficient` application, so the identification is `rfl` — hence
  almost everywhere
  `⇑(normalizedSample abar hS a).1`.  This is exactly the identity the *identity*-gauge
  demand cannot have.
* **No smallness on the certificate's `delta` is needed.**  The converter
  returns a *power* tail, and `ScalarIdentityPowerTail.rebase` trades reference
  scale for amplitude: pushing the base scale out drives the amplitude below any
  prescribed tolerance.  That is why the identity-gauge row was stated
  `∀ eps > 0` and why nothing here demands `delta` below a private constant.
* **The translates are covered by the certificate itself.**  `hquenched`
  produces the row on a set `OmegaEnd` with
  `∀ z, translateCoeff z ⁻¹' OmegaEnd = OmegaEnd`, so a certified sample and all
  of its integer translates carry the row.  No per-`z` certificate is assumed.

The one exponent condition is `rho < 2 * s`, where `s` is the good-tail order
the supply itself chooses.  `s` is not a
frozen constant: it is carried by the block-row
supply and consumed only here, because the corrector datum records its order as
a *field* rather than an index.  At the certificate's `rho = (1 + 3 g) / 4` a
per-`g` order `s := (1 + g) / 4` satisfies both `0 < s < 1/2` and `rho < 2 * s`
for every `g ∈ [0, 1)`, so the admitted range is the whole of `[0,1)`; the
frozen order would have forced `g < 1/6`.

/-! ## Trading reference scale for amplitude -/

/-- **A power tail is a good tail at every prescribed tolerance.**  Rebasing to
a larger reference scale divides the amplitude by a positive power, and the
geometric sum of the rebased tail is below any `eps > 0` once the base is far
enough out. -/

/-! ## The certificate-side block row -/

/-- **The certificate-side input, in the shape `hquenched` produces it.**  A
certified sample lies in a translation-invariant set on which the physical block
row at the comparison matrix `abar` holds, with the row exponent below twice the
private order.

Every field is on `RootAssembly`'s own binder surface: `Omega` is `OmegaEnd`
together with its `∀ z, translateCoeff z ⁻¹' OmegaEnd = OmegaEnd`; `rho` is
`(1 + 3 g) / 4`; `kappa`, `delta`, `S`, `X` are the interface's; `1 ≤ X b` and
`S b ≤ X b` are `hquenched`'s own `(∀ a, 1 ≤ X a)` and `(∀ a, S a ≤ X a)`; and
the row itself is the hypothesis `hhomogenized` consumes, at the same
`Book.Ch02.constantBlockMatrix abar`.  Nothing new is introduced.

The good-tail order `s` is *supplied here*
together with the row, subject only to the corrector cone `0 < s < 1/2` and the
window `rho < 2 * s`.  It is not a global constant, so the provider may choose
it after the contrast exponent `g` — and nothing downstream of the supply ever
sees it. -/
