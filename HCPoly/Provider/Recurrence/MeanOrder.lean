# The annealed mean order of the fixed-grid recurrence

The averaging step of `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence` opens with the aligned
subdivision of the parent cell `⋄_p^q` into its `3^{d(p-j)}` scale-`j` children,
and with the three displays

`0 ≤ A_p(0) ≤ G`, `E[A_p(0)] = E_p`, `E[G] = E_j`,

where `G` is the average of the children's responses.  Averaging the pathwise
order under the law and reading the two expectations gives the mean order
`E_p ≤ E_j`, which is the hypothesis every later step of the recurrence uses.

The pathwise order is the subadditivity among the coarse-block properties taken
from HC over the aligned subdivision, together with the pathwise positivity
clause.  The two expectations are the entrywise Bochner integral of the
response, read through the translation clause: each child is an integer
translate of the cell at the origin, so under stationarity of the coefficient
law its annealed block is `E_j` and the average
of the children's annealed blocks is `E_j` again.  Averaging is monotone for the
Loewner order because the positive semidefinite cone is closed, which is the
content the ambient integral layer supplies.

The consequences the recurrence's later steps read off the mean order are the
determinant identities for the parent-child normalization: the
relative mean `P_{j,p} = E_p^{-1/2}E_jE_p^{-1/2}` lies above the identity, its
determinant is `e^{Δ_{j,p}}`, the increment `Δ_{j,p}` is nonnegative, the
spectral size of `P_{j,p}` is at most `e^{Δ_{j,p}}`, and the trace gap
`b = tr(P_{j,p} - I)` is at most `e^{Δ_{j,p}} - 1`.  All five are the matrix
analysis of a positive definite pair in the Loewner order, applied at the adapted
means.
