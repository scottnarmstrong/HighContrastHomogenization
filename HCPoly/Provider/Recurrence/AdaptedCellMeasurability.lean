# Consumers of the measurability clause over adapted cells

The measurability of the variational coarse block holds unconditionally
on every adapted cell.  This file records what the fixed-grid estimates draw
from it, together with the symmetry of the annealed block, which needs nothing
at all.

The annealed block inherits pathwise symmetry: its entries are integrals of the
entries of the response, and the response is symmetric on every cell, so the
adapted means `E_r^q` are symmetric with no hypothesis.

The scalarization display of `l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging` carries a
measurability binder on the `4d²` entries of the *normalized centered* block
`F^{-1/2}(𝐀 - E)F^{-1/2}`.  Normalization and centering are a fixed affine map
of the entries, so that binder is discharged by the measurability clause on
`𝐀(U; ·)` itself.  With the clause now proved on the adapted cells, the display
applies to the centered moment `v_r^q` and to the centered aligned responses
`X_z` of the fixed-grid recurrence with no hypothesis beyond the grid's own.

/-! ## The annealed block is symmetric -/

/-- **The annealed block of any cell is symmetric.**  Its entries are the
integrals of the entries of the coarse response, which is symmetric pathwise, so
no integrability or measurability hypothesis enters. -/

/-- **The measurability binder of the scalarization display is discharged by the
measurability clause.**  The normalized centered block `F^{-1/2}(𝐀 - E)F^{-1/2}`
has entries that are fixed real-linear combinations of the entries of `𝐀`, so
their measurability is exactly `HasMeasurableCoarseBlock`. -/
