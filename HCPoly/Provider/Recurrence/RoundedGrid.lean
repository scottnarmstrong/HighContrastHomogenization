# The rounded adapted grid

The rounded adapted grid of a metric replaces a positive symmetric
matrix `m` by the entrywise rounding

`Q_ℓ(m) = 3^{-ℓ} ⌈3^ℓ 𝓛(m)⌉`,   `𝓛(m) := |m^{-1}|^{1/2} m^{1/2}`,

at an alignment scale `ℓ ≥ k_0(d)`.  Two properties of that convention are what
the adapted geometry rests on, and both are proved here.

The first is that `Q_ℓ(m)` is again positive.  The eigenvalues of the normalized
square root `𝓛(m)` are the numbers `(λ_i(m)/λ_min(m))^{1/2} ≥ 1`, so
`𝓛(m) ≥ I`; rounding moves each entry by less than `3^{-ℓ}`, and the spectral
norm of a `d × d` matrix is at most `d` times the largest absolute value of its
entries, so the rounding perturbs the quadratic form by at most
`d 3^{-ℓ} ≤ d 3^{-k_0(d)}`.  This is exactly the quantity the choice of `k_0(d)`
controls, and `kZero_spec` bounds it by `1/101`.  Hence `Q_ℓ(m)` stays positive
definite, and the adapted cells `⋄_j^q = q□_j` are genuine cells.

The second is integrality.  Every entry of `Q_ℓ(m)` is `3^{-ℓ}` times an
integer, so for every scale `j ≥ ℓ` the matrix `3^j Q_ℓ(m)` has integer entries
and the aligned translation vectors `3^j q w`, `w ∈ ℤ^d`, lie in `ℤ^d`.  That is
the integrality clause of the aligned subdivision in the coarse-block properties
taken from HC, and it is what lets stationarity be applied to the
child cells.
