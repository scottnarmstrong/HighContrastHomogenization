# Translation covariance of the coarse block and the stationarity transport

This is the translation covariance of the variational coarse block, among the
properties taken from HC in `s.introduction`: the pair

`𝐀(U + z; a) = 𝐀(U; T_z a)`,   `𝐀_*(U + z; a) = 𝐀_*(U; T_z a)`,   `z ∈ ℤ^d`,

and the consequence drawn from it, that under stationarity of the coefficient
law the translated blocks have the same law and hence the same expectation
whenever that expectation exists.

The pathwise identity is a change of variables in the variational definition of
the coarse block (`s.introduction`): translating a competitor is a bijection
between the admissible classes over `U + z` and over `U` that preserves the
energy average, so the two infima agree.  The coefficient field of the
coefficient space is an almost everywhere class, and the translation action `T_z`
of the coefficient-law setup in `s.introduction` is the class of `a(· + z)`; the
coarse response sees only the class, so the identity holds at every sample, with
no null set left
over.  The sharp half of the display is the image of the first half under the
primal-adjoint involution `H ↦ R H⁻¹ R` of `s.scale.selection`, which is how
`𝐀_*` is written here.

The annealed half is the change of variables `E[g ∘ T_z] = E[g]` under the law,
whose only input beyond stationarity of the coefficient law is that the entries
of the coarse response are measurable for the law, another of the properties
taken from HC.  The printed hedge "whenever they are finite" is the integrability
guard: it transports too, so an aligned cell inherits the finiteness of the mean
of the cell at the origin.

At the aligned adapted cells of a rounded geometry (`s.scale.selection`) the
translation vectors are integral, so the transport applies to them directly.  The resulting identity
`E[A_j^q(z)] = E_j^q` at every aligned center is what the averaging step of
`p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence` consumes when it replaces the annealed block of
each child by the mean at the parent scale, together with its averaged form
`E[G] = E_j^q`.
