# The coarse block is subadditive over the aligned subdivision

This is the subadditivity among the coarse-block properties taken from HC, in
the form the fixed-grid recurrence consumes it at its averaging step: for a
rounded grid `q`, scales `j ≤ p`, and the aligned subdivision of `⋄_p^q` into
its `3^{d(p-j)}` scale-`j` children,
`𝐀(⋄_p^q) ≤ 3^{-d(p-j)} Σ_w 𝐀(z_w + ⋄_j^q)`, which is the first display of
`e.fixed.geometry.parent.child` with the uniform weights `|U_i| / |U|` of a
subdivision into cells of equal volume.

Nothing here is specific to the grid beyond the geometry already recorded: the
children are nonempty bounded open convex domains contained in the parent,
pairwise disjoint, and covering the parent up to a null set, which is exactly the
hypothesis of the general subadditivity of the companion file; and they are
translates of one another, so their common volume collapses the printed weight
`|U_i| / |U|` to `3^{-d(p-j)}`.  A field of the coefficient space enters through a
measurable everywhere elliptic representative, which changes no coarse block.

The conclusion is recorded twice: as the quadratic-form inequality that defines
the Loewner order on doubled blocks, and as the Loewner inequality itself between
the flattened matrices, where the average on the right is the honest matrix
average of the printed display.
