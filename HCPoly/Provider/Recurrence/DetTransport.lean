# Determinant transport for the fixed-grid recurrence

The proof of `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence` compares two consecutive adapted
scales through the relative mean `P = E_p^{-1/2} E_j E_p^{-1/2}`.  Once the mean
order `E_p ≤ E_j` is available, everything the recurrence asks of `P` is a
statement about a positive definite matrix above the identity, and that is what
is proved here.

The determinant identities for the parent-child normalization read
`det P = e^{Δ}`, `Δ ≥ 0` and `|P| ≤ e^{Δ}` for the determinant increment
`Δ = log det E_j - log det E_p`.  The determinant identity is the change of
variables under the congruence; the sign of `Δ` is monotonicity of the
determinant for the Loewner order; and the spectral bound is the observation
that the largest eigenvalue of a matrix above the identity is at most the
product of all of them.

The recurrence then needs the trace gap `b = tr(P - I)`, and the step
`b = Σ(λ_i - 1) ≤ Π λ_i - 1 = e^{Δ} - 1` of the fixed-grid proof.  Its content
is the elementary inequality that for reals at least one the sum of the excesses
is at most the excess of the product, proved here by induction on the index set
and then read on the eigenvalues.

Finally the fixed-grid proof passes from the child normalization to the parent
one by "the exact congruence"
`E_p^{-1/2}(G - E_j)E_p^{-1/2} = C^t (E_j^{-1/2}(G - E_j)E_j^{-1/2}) C` with
`C = E_j^{1/2} E_p^{-1/2}`.  That identity holds for an arbitrary matrix in
place of `G` and is pure square-root algebra; it is recorded in that generality.

/-! ## The sum of excesses and the excess of the product -/

/-- For reals at least one, the sum of the excesses over one is at most the
excess over one of the product.  Adjoining a factor multiplies the product by
`f a` and adds `f a - 1` to the sum, and the two differ by the nonnegative
product `(f a - 1)(∏ f - 1)`. -/
