# Colour separation for adapted cells

The finite-range averaging lemma colours an aligned adapted cell
`3^j 𝐪 w + ⋄_j^𝐪` by the residue of its index `w = 3^{-j}𝐪^{-1}z` modulo three.
The purpose of the rounded-grid design is that two distinct cells of the same
colour are separated in `ℓ^∞`-distance by at least one, which is what makes the
unit-range assumption applicable to them.

Two quantitative facts carry that conclusion.  The first is that a rounded grid
is uniformly positive: the normalization `𝓛(m)` is at least the identity and
the rounding perturbs the quadratic form by at most `d 3^{-ℓ} ≤ 1/101`, so
`𝐪 ≥ (100/101) I`.  Consequently the grid map cannot contract the sup norm by
more than the factor `(100/101)/d`.  The second is that at any scale at or above
the alignment the cells are large: `3^j ≥ 3^{k_0(d)} ≥ 101 d`, this being the
content of the choice of `k_0(d)`.  Two same-colour indices differ by at least
three in some coordinate, so the corresponding points of the two cells differ by
more than `2 · 3^j` in that coordinate before the grid map is applied, and by at
least `200` after it.

The colour classes themselves need no new carrier: the residue map
`w ↦ (w i mod 3)_i` takes values in `(ZMod 3)^d`, so a finite family of aligned
indices splits into at most `3^d` same-colour classes, the count the printed
proof uses.
