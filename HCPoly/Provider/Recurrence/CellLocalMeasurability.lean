# The response of a cell is measurable for the sigma-field of that cell

The first of the coarse-block properties taken from HC asks for
`F(U)`-measurability of `𝐀(U)`, not merely measurability: the coarse response
of a cell must be a function of the coefficient field *inside* that cell.  This
file proves the clause in that form, on every bounded open cell of positive
volume, hence on
every adapted cell.

Only one step separates it from the measurability already proved.  The
representative map from the coefficient space into the exact coarse source
carries the generating linear statistics of `F(U)` to the generating bilinear
tests of the source's own sigma-field of `U` — the two families of test
functions are the same, and the representative agrees with the field almost
everywhere — so the map is measurable for the local sigma-fields and not only
for the global ones.  The coarse-grained energy of the cell is already known to
be local on the source, and the entries of the response are its polarizations.
