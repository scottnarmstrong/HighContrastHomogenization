# The pathwise symmetry and positivity of the response over adapted cells

The first of the coarse-block properties taken from HC asserts that the coarse
block response `𝐀(U; a)` of a Lipschitz cell is, pathwise in the coefficient
field, a symmetric positive definite doubled matrix.  For the adapted cubes
`⋄_j^q = q□_j` of a rounded geometry and their aligned translates
`3^j q w + ⋄_j^q` this file proves both halves.

Symmetry needs no hypothesis at all: the coarse block response of *any* subset
of `ℝ^d` is symmetric, the off-diagonal entries being the polarization of the
variational quantity.

Positivity is the deterministic coarse-graining theory of a bounded open convex
domain, transported to the adapted cell.  A rounded adapted grid is invertible,
so the adapted cell is a nonempty bounded open convex domain, hence a chapter 2
domain; the coarse response of a field of the coefficient space on it is then the
chapter 2 coarse block matrix of that field read as a coefficient object, which
is positive definite.

Two consequences are recorded for the fixed-grid recurrence.  The annealed block
of an adapted cell inherits positivity as soon as the response is integrable, so
the positivity binders on the adapted means `E_j^q` follow from the finiteness
binders.  And the Schur ordering `σ_* ≤ σ` becomes available on every adapted
cell, as it already was on every centered cube.
