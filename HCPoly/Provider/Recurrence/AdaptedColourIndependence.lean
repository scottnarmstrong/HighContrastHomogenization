# Independence of the responses of one colour class

Putting the colour separation together with the grouping induction gives the
second step of `l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging`: the coarse responses of a
same-colour family of aligned adapted cells form a jointly independent family.

The random variables are recorded in the two forms the averaging step uses.  The
first is the bare entry `𝐀(z + ⋄_j^𝐪)_{αβ}` of the coarse response.  The second
is the entry of the normalized centred block `R^{-1/2}(𝐀 - E)R^{-1/2}`, which is
the variable the printed proof calls `X_i`; normalization and centring by
deterministic blocks are a fixed affine map of the entries, so they preserve both
locality and independence.  Since the moment inequality applied to the family
asks for measurability against the global structure of the coefficient space,
that consequence of locality is recorded as well.

The index type is left arbitrary and the colour condition is carried as a
hypothesis, so a colour class of any concrete family can be used; the
specialization to the class `{w ∈ Z : w ≡ c}` of a finite family `Z` of aligned
indices is stated last, in the subtype form a finite-sum moment inequality
consumes.
