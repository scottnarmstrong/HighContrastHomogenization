# The positive-gap estimate read at the carriers of the fixed-grid recurrence

`l.fixed.geometry.positive.gap` is proved for abstract random blocks: a positive excess `D`
caught below `Ĝ = P + Y`, a bound `b` on the mean of `tr D`, and the mixed norms
`x = ‖D‖_{L^Q(S_Q)}`, `y = ‖Y‖_{L^Q(S_Q)}`.  Three passages carry it onto the
data of `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`, and they are taken here.

*The expectation identities.*  With `F̂` the response over the parent cell and
`Ĝ` the average of the responses over its aligned children, both normalized by
the parent mean `E_p^q`, the reference proof records `E[D] = B` and
`E[tr D] = b` for `D = Ĝ - F̂` and `B = P_{j,p}^q - I`.  Both are the
interchange of a fixed linear functional with the block-valued Bochner integral:
normalization is a two-sided multiplication by a deterministic matrix and the
trace is a linear functional, so each passes through.  The mean of the
normalized parent response is the identity and the mean of the normalized
average is the relative mean, so `E[D] = P_{j,p}^q - I`.  Since `D` is positive
along every realization, the `L^1` norm of `tr D` is its mean, which is the
fail-closed form the integrated trace-power display takes as its gap hypothesis.

*The finiteness read-back.*  The integrated display is an inequality in
`ℝ≥0∞`.  On the event that the two mixed norms are finite it becomes the
printed quadratic inequality between real numbers, and the two constants it
carries are reconciled into the single constant `C = 2^{Q-2}(2m)^{1-1/Q}` the
absorption step takes, at the cost of `(2m)^{1-1/Q} ≥ 1`.

*The mixed-norm triangle step.*  The closing estimate of `l.fixed.geometry.positive.gap` is
pointwise; the conclusion is between mixed norms.  Passing between them costs
the `L^Q` norm of a constant, which is that constant exactly because the law is
a probability measure — the one place in the chain where the normalization of
the law is genuinely used.

/-- The identity, read as a continuous linear map from the coordinatewise
(finite-product) presentation of `FullBlockMat d` into the matrix type itself.
Continuity is automatic on a finite-dimensional space; the map exists only to
move Bochner-integral values between the two topologically identical but
differently normed presentations `FullBlockMat d` carries — the Loewner-order
one open in this file and the coordinatewise one the generic product API
uses. -/
