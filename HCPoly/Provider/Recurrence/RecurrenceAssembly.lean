# `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`

The fixed-grid recurrence is assembled here from the estimates of the section.
On one deterministic rounded adapted grid `q` of alignment `ℓ`, at a child scale
`j ≥ ℓ` and a parent scale `p = j + h` above it, the parent cell is partitioned
by `3^{dh}` aligned children; write `Ĝ` for the average of the responses over
those children, `E_j` and `E_p` for the two adapted means and
`Δ = Δ_{j,p}^q` for the determinant increment.

Four displays are composed.

*The averaging step.*  The centred average `Ĝ - E_j`, normalized by the child
mean, has mixed norm at most `C(d,Q) 3^{-hd/2}` times the child moment `v_j^q`;
this is `l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging` read at the aligned subdivision,
whose cardinality `3^{dh}` supplies the printed gain.

*The transport of the normalization.*  The mean order `E_p ≤ E_j` and the ideal
property of the Schatten norm carry that estimate from the child normalization
to the parent one, at the cost of `(2d)^{1/Q}e^{Δ}`.

*The positive gap.*  Pathwise `0 ≤ 𝐀_p ≤ Ĝ`, so the normalized excess
`D = (Ĝ - 𝐀_p)^~` is positive with mean `B = P_{j,p}^q - I`; the determinant
transport bounds the spectral size of `P_{j,p}^q` by `e^{Δ}` and its trace gap by
`e^{Δ} - 1`.  The positive-gap estimate then bounds the parent moment by
`C(y + Φ_Q(Δ))`, where `y` is the transported mixed norm of the centred average.

*The gain.*  Substituting the transported bound for `y` produces the printed
contraction: a geometric factor `3^{-hd/2}e^{Δ}` on the child moment plus the
increment's own gain `Φ_Q(Δ)`, both carrying one constant `C_rec(d, Q)`.

The mixed norms are `ℝ≥0∞`-valued, and the passage to the real inequalities the
positive-gap estimate is stated in is made on the finiteness hypotheses the
proposition carries.  The exponent `Q` is an even integer, which is what makes
the Schatten size a continuous function of the entries: the inner power `Q/2` of
`|H|_{S_Q} = (tr((H²)^{Q/2}))^{1/Q}` is then an integer, the functional calculus
collapses to a matrix power and the trace is a polynomial.  That is the content
of the opening section.
