# The ideal property of the Schatten size

The fixed-grid recurrence changes the normalization of the averaged response
from the child mean `E_j` to the parent mean `E_p` through the exact congruence
`E_p^{-1/2}(G-E_j)E_p^{-1/2} = C^t(E_j^{-1/2}(G-E_j)E_j^{-1/2})C` with
`C = E_j^{1/2}E_p^{-1/2}`, and then transports the Schatten size across it.  The
result is the averaged fluctuation after the change of normalization, in the
proof of `p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`, whose constant is allowed to
depend on the dimension and on the exponent.

The transport is the ideal property of the Schatten norm, read through the
scalar Loewner sandwich.  A symmetric block `H` is caught between
`∓|H|_{S_Q}I`; congruence preserves the Loewner order, so `C^tHC` is caught
between `∓|H|_{S_Q}C^tC`; and `C^tC` is the relative mean
`P = E_p^{-1/2}E_jE_p^{-1/2}` of the determinant transport, which lies below
`e^{Δ}I`.  So `C^tHC` is caught between `∓|H|_{S_Q}e^{Δ}I`, and a block caught
between `∓tI` has Schatten size at most `(2d)^{1/Q}t`.  The chain costs the
dimensional factor `(2d)^{1/Q}`, which is the shape of the printed constant
`C(d,Q)`; nothing downstream sees the loss.

The exact ideal inequality `|C^tHC|_{S_Q} ≤ |C^tC|·|H|_{S_Q}` is stronger than
what is proved here, and is not available by this argument: it asks the spectrum
of `C^tHC` to be dominated by that of `H` in the sense of majorization, whereas
the Loewner order only bounds each eigenvalue separately.

The final section carries the pointwise estimate to the mixed norm
`‖·‖_{L^Q(S_Q)}`, which is where the recurrence uses it: combined with the
averaging estimate of `l.fixed.geometry.matrix.averaging` at the child
normalization it produces the printed display at the parent normalization.

/-- **The ideal property of the Schatten size, in the normalization the
fixed-grid recurrence uses.**  Changing the normalization of a symmetric block
from the child mean to the parent mean multiplies its Schatten size by at most
`(2d)^{1/Q}e^{Δ}`, the determinant increment entering through the Loewner bound
`P ≤ e^{Δ}I` on the relative mean. -/
