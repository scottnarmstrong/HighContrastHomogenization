# Quantitative homogenization under uniform ellipticity

`t.uniform.homogenization` is the uniformly elliptic instance of the general
polynomial homogenization theorem `t.random.homogenization`: a `ℤ^d`-stationary
law of unit range whose fields satisfy `e.uniform.ellipticity` with constants
`0 < λ ≤ 1 ≤ Λ` carries the whole conclusion list of the general theorem, at
discount exponent `g = 0`, with the homogenization length bounded by a power of
`2 + Λ/λ`.

The three data the general theorem quantifies over are produced here from
`e.uniform.ellipticity` alone.

* The reference block is the diagonal doubled block `diag(2Λ, 2λ⁻¹)`.  On every
  standard aligned cube the coarse block response of a `(λ, Λ)`-elliptic field is
  dominated by it, with no discount factor: the constant competitor is admissible
  at every cube, and the doubled quadratic form of a `(λ, Λ)`-elliptic matrix is
  bounded by `2Λ|p|² + 2λ⁻¹|q|²`.  Its reference aspect ratio is at most `4Λ/λ`.
* The gauge is `Ψ(t) = exp(t^d)`, with growth witness `2`.
* The source scale is identically zero, so its tail is trivial and the two-part
  tail of the general theorem collapses: the second term is then
  `exp(-(c t)^d)`, of the same shape as the first, and a dilation of the scale
  absorbs both into `exp(-t^d)`, the tail written at `e.uniform.scale.tail`.

**Scope.**  The Dirichlet clause below is the homogeneous negative-Sobolev
estimate of the general theorem, on the adapted cells of the homogenized matrix.
The `L²` estimate `e.uniform.dirichlet`, which carries a forcing term `f` and is
read on the ellipsoids `e.homogenized.ellipsoids`, is deduced in the reference
text from that estimate by a further duality argument — harmonic replacement on a
mesoscopic grid against a constant-coefficient adjoint problem — which is not
carried out here.  The large-scale energy estimate `e.uniform.energy` and the
first-order approximation are stated on the ellipsoids `E_r`, as in the reference
text.

/-! ## Theorem `t.uniform.homogenization` -/

/-- **Theorem `t.uniform.homogenization`**: quantitative homogenization under
uniform ellipticity.

For a `ℤ^d`-stationary law of unit range whose fields satisfy
`e.uniform.ellipticity` with `0 < λ ≤ 1 ≤ Λ` there are a homogenized matrix with
positive definite symmetric part, a corrector family, and a homogenization scale
`X ≥ 1` whose tail is `e.uniform.scale.tail`: the exponent is the dimension, and
the deterministic factor in front of `t` is a power of `2 + Λ/λ` with a
dimensional exponent.  On one translation invariant event of full probability the
Dirichlet estimate, the corrector equation and estimate, the Liouville
classification, the large-scale energy estimate `e.uniform.energy` and the
first-order approximation all hold.

The estimates are those of the general theorem `t.random.homogenization`,
specialized at the exponent `g = 0`: the two-part tail collapses to `exp(-t^d)`
because the source scale of a uniformly elliptic law vanishes, and the
homogenization length `L ≤ (2 + Π K)^C` becomes `(2 + Λ/λ)^C` because the
reference block `diag(2Λ, 2λ⁻¹)` has reference aspect ratio `Π ≤ 4Λ/λ`.

**Scope.**  The Dirichlet clause is the homogeneous negative-Sobolev estimate on
the adapted cells of the homogenized matrix, not the `L²` estimate
`e.uniform.dirichlet` with a forcing term `f` on the ellipsoids
`e.homogenized.ellipsoids`; the reference text deduces the latter from the
former by a separate duality argument, which is not carried out here.  The
large-scale energy estimate and the first-order approximation are stated on the
ellipsoids `E_r` of `e.homogenized.ellipsoids`. -/
