# The candidate of the short test

The candidate witness of `p.successful.short.bridge` is the next point
on the fixed constant-speed projective path from the current witness to the
canonical metric of the old grid's terminal block: the path point at parameter
`min{c_hop/d_pr, 1}`, and the endpoint itself when the two projective classes
already agree.  Two of the three candidate clauses of the proposition are proved
here — the candidate is a positive witness, and the projective jump to it is at
most the hop length.  The third, the bound on the cross-grid factor, is the hop
distortion read at those two facts.

The path point `m(θ) = m₀^{1/2}(m₀^{-1/2}m₁m₀^{-1/2})^θm₀^{1/2}` is a congruence
of the real power of the normalized pair, so normalizing it by `m₀^{-1/2}` gives
back that real power exactly.  Positive definiteness is then the positive
definiteness of the real power carried across the congruence, and the printed
form of the projective distance — half the sum of the logarithms of the sizes of
the normalized pair and of its inverse — turns the constant-speed bound into the
two size bounds of the real power.  This is where the path is *constant speed*:
each of the two logarithms is multiplied by `θ`, so the distance is at most `θ`
times the distance to the endpoint.

The zero branch costs nothing: the candidate is the endpoint, and the distance to
it is the vanishing distance itself.
