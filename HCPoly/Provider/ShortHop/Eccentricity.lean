# The witness eccentricity is the exponential of the projective distance

The hop-index bootstrap `e.global.selection.eccentricity` reads the
identity

`d_pr([I],[μ]) = ½ log(|μ| |μ^{-1}|) = log 𝔢_q`

and turns the prefix bound `d_pr([I],[μ_i]) ≤ i c_hop` into the eccentricity
bound `𝔢_{q_i} ≤ e^{i c_hop}`, hence into a bound on the boundary constant
`B_q = C_d 𝔢_q ζ_g`.

The identity is immediate in the encoding used here.  The projective distance is
half the sum of the logarithms of the two relative sizes, the relative size of a
positive witness against the identity is its spectral size, the relative size of
the identity against it is the spectral size of its inverse, and the witness
eccentricity is the square root of the product of the two.  The square root
halves the logarithm, which is exactly the factor the projective distance
carries.

Nothing in this file mentions a grid: the eccentricity is a function of the
witness alone, as the carrier layer records.
