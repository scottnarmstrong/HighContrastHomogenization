# The scalar size of a centered block, read spectrally

The centered history `e.scale.selection.fluctuation.history` measures a *centered*
doubled block `A_j^q(z) - E_j^q` against a positive reference block, so the
scalar size that enters it is the two-sided one: the least `t ≥ 0` with
`-tF ≤ H ≤ tF`.  The identification of that infimum with the spectral norm of
the normalized block is the only fact about it the majorization argument needs,
and this file proves it.

The one new ingredient is the two-sided companion of `norm_le_iff_le_smul_one`:
a symmetric matrix caught between `∓tI` has spectral norm at most `t`.  Its
proof is the factorization

`t²I - X² = (tI - X)(tI + X) = √(tI+X) (tI - X) √(tI+X)`,

which is legitimate because the square root of `tI + X` commutes with
`tI - X = 2tI - (tI + X)`; the C⋆ identity `‖X‖² = ‖X*X‖` then reads the norm
off the square.

Three consequences follow at once, and they are exactly the three steps the
proof of `p.fixed.geometry.one.grid.propagation` takes with the centered maximum: the size is
attained, so a change of the reference block costs the relative size of the two
references; the size is dominated by the Schatten size of the same pair, which
is how the centered moments `v_j^q` enter; and the size is a continuous function
of the entries of the block, so the centered maximum is a measurable statistic.
