# The entry contrast against the Euclidean imbalance

The last display of the proof of `t.polynomial.entry` converts
the imbalance of the Euclidean annealed block at the entry generation into the
annealed contrast there,

`Θ_m - 1 ≤ 3(𝔡(F_m) - 1)`,

with `Θ_m` the intrinsic annealed contrast of `e.Theta.m` and
`𝔡` the canonical imbalance of `e.scale.selection.canonical.metric`, both read
on `F_m = 𝐀̄(□_m)`.

Two things are proved.

*Definedness.*  The printed argument obtains the finiteness and positive
definiteness of `F_m` from the Euclidean mean comparison
`e.initial.source.bounds`, which is available at generations at or
above the source burn.  Both are in fact consequences of
`e.coarse.ellipticity` alone, at every generation: the coarse response of a
centered cube is integrable and its expectation is positive definite, and
the annealed primal-adjoint order then puts the block above its own sharp.  The
generation hypothesis is carried below for the shape of the entry argument and
is not needed.

*The comparison.*  The bridge itself is `Θ ≤ 𝔡` on any symmetric positive
doubled block — one factor of three stronger than the printed display, which is
recovered from it because `𝔡 ≥ 1`.

The printed route to the display passes through the *uncorrected* Schur ratio
`Θ̃ = |σ_*^{-1/2} σ σ_*^{-1/2}|`, in two steps: a factor-three comparison
`Θ - 1 ≤ 3(Θ̃ - 1)`, and then `Θ̃ - 1 ≤ 𝔡 - 1` read off the sharp ordering.  The
second step's source, the lower block inequality of [Armstrong–Kuusi, Lemma 2.6, (2.82)], is false as printed: at Schur data `σ_* = 1, σ = 9, k = 4` in
one dimension the printed bounds are exceeded, both being linear in `Θ̃ - 1`
where the extremal configurations grow quadratically.  Neither step is used
here.

The route taken instead is the intrinsic minimum itself.  `Θ` minimizes the
normalized skew-corrected Schur form over the skew matrices, so *any* skew
matrix bounds it; the choice `h = ½(k - kᵗ)` leaves the symmetric coordinate
`r = ½(k + kᵗ)` and the corrected form `B = σ + rᵗσ_*⁻¹r`, and the fourfold
Schur bound of `e.response.canonical.imbalance` — the imbalance ordering
`F ≤ 𝔡 F^♯` read at the vector whose second Schur coordinate vanishes — gives
`σ + 4rᵗσ_*⁻¹r ≤ 𝔡 σ_*`, hence `B ≤ 𝔡 σ_*`.  So `𝔡` is admissible for the
infimum defining `Θ`, which is exactly `Θ ≤ 𝔡`.  The uncorrected ratio never
appears.

/-! ## The bridge -/

/-- **The intrinsic contrast is below the canonical imbalance**, `Θ ≤ 𝔡`, on
every symmetric positive definite doubled block.

The skew matrix `h = ½(k - kᵗ)` corrects the Schur skew coordinate to its
symmetric part `r = ½(k + kᵗ)`, and the imbalance ordering `F ≤ 𝔡 F^♯` of
`e.scale.selection.canonical.metric`, read on the doubled coordinate whose second
Schur component vanishes, bounds `σ + rᵗσ_*⁻¹r` by `𝔡 σ_*`.  That is an
admissible Loewner scaling for the infimum defining the intrinsic contrast, so
the infimum is at most `𝔡`. -/

/-! ## The entry conversion -/

/-- **The entry contrast conversion** of `t.polynomial.entry`:
at every generation the annealed contrast of the centered cube is converted into
the imbalance of the Euclidean annealed block there,

`Θ_m - 1 ≤ 3(𝔡(F_m) - 1)`.

The comparison `Θ_m ≤ 𝔡(F_m)` is one factor of three stronger; the printed
display follows because the imbalance is at least one.  The source-burn
hypothesis, which the printed definedness step consumes, is not needed: the
definedness of `F_m` is available from `e.coarse.ellipticity` at every
generation. -/
