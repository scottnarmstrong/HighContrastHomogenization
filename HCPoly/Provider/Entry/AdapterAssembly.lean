# The adapted-to-Euclidean comparison constant

The comparison between adapted and Euclidean cubes, in the shape the response
and transfer proposition `p.response.transfer` binds: one constant, fixed before
the law, with the two comparison estimates at every rounded grid, every
alignment and every admissible triple of generations.

The two halves are assembled from `AdapterForward` and `AdapterReverse`.  The
cross-grid factors are the two absolute bounds of
`e.rounded.grid.bounds`: `|q^{-1}| ≤ 101/100` forward, so that
half carries no eccentricity, and `|q| ≤ (100/99)𝔢_q` in reverse, which is where
the printed `𝔢_q` enters — exactly once, as the printed statement has it.

*The constant.*  What is exhibited is `C(d,g) = 15274d^3(1-g)^{-1}`, not the
printed dimension-only `C_AE(d)`.  The reverse half reads each boundary cell of
the adapted filling through a Euclidean filling of its own, and that composition
spends one more geometric series than the printed boundary decomposition does.
The frozen consumer obligation binds its constant after the burn exponent `g`, so
the dependence is admissible there; the printed dimension-only constant would
need the boundary-shell reading of the source rather than the composed filling.
