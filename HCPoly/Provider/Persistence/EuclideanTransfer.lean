# The Euclidean transfer of the entry mean

The comparison between adapted and Euclidean cubes compares a Euclidean annealed
block with an adapted mean up to an error measured in units of the reference
block `𝐄`.  This file turns two such comparisons, read on the two distinct strict
generation chains of the forward and of the reverse comparison, into the
two-sided near-isometry `e.response.transfer.block.comparison` and a bound on the
Euclidean imbalance after the transfer.

The mechanism is one congruence and one rearrangement.  The congruence is the
entry ratio `Λ_t = |(E_t^q)^{-1/2}𝐄(E_t^q)^{-1/2}|`, one of the normalization
constants of the transfer: it is exactly the least scalar with `𝐄 ≤ Λ_t E_t^q`,
so an error `c𝐄` whose congruenced size `cΛ_t` is below a tolerance `η` is an
error below `ηE_t^q`.  The forward comparison then reads as the upper Euclidean
comparison.

The reverse comparison is one-sided in the wrong direction: it bounds the
adapted mean at the auxiliary scale by the Euclidean block.  The persistence
clause at that scale turns it into a lower bound for the Euclidean block in terms
of the entry mean, at the cost of the factor `(1+δ_ad)^d`, which is the lower
Euclidean comparison.  The tolerance conditions `e.response.transfer.tolerances`
were chosen exactly so that the two one-sided bounds close up into the symmetric
sandwich.

The last step is `e.global.selection.metric.comparison` at the sandwich: the Euclidean
block is positive definite because it dominates a positive multiple of the entry
mean — the Euclidean cube is not contained in the window, so this, and not the
window estimate, is the route to its definedness.

comparison `C ≤ A + c𝐄` in the wrong direction, whose error is below `η₋B`,

Rearranging gives `(ϱ^{-1} - η₋)B ≤ A`, and the tolerance conditions
`e.response.transfer.tolerances` weaken the scalar to the symmetric one. -/
