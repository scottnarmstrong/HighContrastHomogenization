# The adapted persistence of the annealed means

The persistence of the adapted block above the response scale reads the adapted
means of a rounded grid at every scale above the entry scale in both directions:
the coarser mean lies below the entry mean, and the entry mean lies below
`(1+δ_ad)^d` times the coarser one.  The first half is the annealed mean order of
`p.fixed.geometry.parent.child.recurrence`.  The second is the determinant account.

Write `Ξ(H) = det(H)^{1/d}` for the determinant root of a doubled block.  The
determinant clause for the canonical metric reads, on a block that dominates its
own sharp, as `1 ≤ det(H) ≤ 𝔡(H)^d`, and the annealed primal-adjoint order makes
every adapted mean of the tower dominate its own sharp.  So the coarser mean has
determinant at least one, and the entry mean has determinant at most the `d`-th
power of its imbalance, which the adapted-imbalance hypothesis caps at `1+δ_ad`.
The determinant quotient of the ordered pair is therefore at most `(1+δ_ad)^d`,
and `e.global.selection.metric.loss` turns a determinant quotient bounded by
`r^d` into the Loewner comparison `E ≤ r^d F` for the pair it is read on.

The account is unconditional in the sense that it consumes only the finiteness of
the entry mean: the finiteness of the coarser mean, which both halves need in
order to denote, is supplied by the upward integrability of the companion file.
