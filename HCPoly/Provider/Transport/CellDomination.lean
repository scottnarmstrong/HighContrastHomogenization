# Domination of an adapted response by a reference block

The well-definedness paragraph of `p.two.grid.transport` reads one
pathwise inequality — the coarse response of an adapted cell lies below a
multiple of the reference block `𝐄` — and extracts from it everything the
printed quantities need in order to denote.  Two extractions are needed, and
both are recorded here in the generality in which the transport uses them, with
no probability in sight.

The first is entrywise: a symmetric doubled block whose quadratic form is caught
between zero and that of `c𝐄` has all its entries bounded by `2|c|` times the
entry scale of `𝐄`.  That is what makes the annealed block an expectation.

The second is the centered Schatten size at the block's own normalization.
Writing `Ĝ = E^{-1/2}𝐀E^{-1/2}` for the normalized response, the centered
normalization is `Ĝ - I`; it is above `-I` for free, since `Ĝ` is positive
semidefinite, and it is below `tI` as soon as `tr Ĝ ≤ t`, a positive
semidefinite matrix being below its own trace.  The scalar Loewner sandwich
`-(1+|t|)I ≤ Ĝ - I ≤ (1+|t|)I` then gives the Schatten size directly.  The
trace hypothesis is in turn a consequence of the same Loewner bound, the
congruence by `E^{-1/2}` being order preserving and the trace monotone.

/-- **The entrywise bound on a dominated coarse response.**  A coarse response
below `c𝐄` in the Loewner order has every entry bounded by `2|c|` times the
entry scale of the reference block; the lower bound comes from the response's
own positivity, which needs no hypothesis. -/

congruence by `E^{-1/2}` preserves the Loewner order and the trace is monotone,

`Ĝ = E^{-1/2}𝐀E^{-1/2}` is positive semidefinite, hence below `(tr Ĝ)I`; if its
trace is at most `t`, the centered normalization `Ĝ - I` is caught between
`∓(1+|t|)I`, and the Schatten size of a block in such a sandwich is at most
`(2d)^{1/Q}` times the width. -/
