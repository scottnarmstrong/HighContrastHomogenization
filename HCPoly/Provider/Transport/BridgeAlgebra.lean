# The algebra of the bridge congruence

`p.two.grid.transport` compares the terminal annealed block of the
old grid with the terminal annealed block of the new one through the near
isometry `(1 - η_x)H ≤ F ≤ (1 + η_x)H`, and reads that comparison through the
congruence `S = H^{1/2}F^{-1/2}`.  Two displays record what the comparison says
about `S`: the normalization bounds `e.two.grid.inverse.comparison`
and the determinant bounds `e.two.grid.determinant`.

Both are proved here, in the generality in which the transport proof uses them:
`H` and `F` are arbitrary positive definite doubled blocks.  The first step is
the identity `S^tS = F^{-1/2}HF^{-1/2}`, which says that the Gram matrix of the
bridge is the normalization of the old terminal block by the new one; after
that, the first display is the comparison conjugated by `F^{-1/2}`, and the
second is the comparison with determinants taken.

The determinant display carries the only arithmetic in the paragraph.  The
matrices have size `2d` while the determinant root uses the `d`-th root, so a
scalar dilation by `c` multiplies the determinant by `c^{2d}` and the root by
`c^2`; that is where the squares in `(1 - η_x)^2` and `(1 + η_x)^2` come from.
