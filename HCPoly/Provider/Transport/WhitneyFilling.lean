# The maximal filling of a target by the cells of a second grid

The filling family `𝒱_a(W;q)` of `l.two.grid.whitney`(i): among the
aligned `q`-cells of scale `a ≤ n`, the *selected* ones are those contained in the
target `W` whose aligned parent of scale `a+1` is not, together with all the
scale-`n` cells contained in `W`.  This is the family the cross-grid rows
`e.two.grid.whitney.volumes` and the finite cross-grid exhaustion are indexed
by, and the one the transport reads as `𝒱_r(W;q)` in
`e.two.grid.whitney.average`.

Three structural facts are proved here, all of them for an arbitrary target set.
The selected cells are pairwise disjoint *across all scales*: a finer selected
cell inside a coarser one would have its parent inside the coarser one too, hence
inside `W`, which the selection rule forbids.  Each is contained in `W` by
definition -- this is the containment convention the window hypothesis relies on,
and it is a property of the construction rather than an arithmetic fact about
triadic ratios.  And each scale carries only finitely many selected cells,
because a selected cell contains its own center, the centers of one scale form a
lattice, and the target is bounded.

/-- **A cell contained in the target has a selected ancestor.**  Taking the
coarsest ancestor still contained in `W`, within the scale range of the filling,
produces a selected cell containing the given one: either that ancestor sits at
the starting scale `n`, or its own parent escapes `W`.  This is the step
"let `b` be the largest scale in `{J,…,n}` such that `C^{(b)} ⊆ W`" of
`l.two.grid.whitney`(i). -/
