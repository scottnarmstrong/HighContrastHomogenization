# The centered bound for a dominated cell

The centered displays of `e.source.adapted.bound` — the centered `L^Q` bound
for the early target cells and its source-tail form — rest on one pathwise
inequality, the normalized centered bound
`e.two.grid.whitney.centered.split`: if a response and its
mean are both below multiples of the reference block, then the Schatten size of
the centered response, normalized by any positive block `F`, is at most
`(2d)^{1/Q}Λ(F;𝐄)` times the sum of the two multiples.

Only two facts enter.  A symmetric block caught between `∓tF` has normalized
Schatten size at most `(2d)^{1/Q}t`, because the congruence by `F^{-1/2}` turns
the sandwich into a sandwich against the identity and the Schatten norm of such
a block is read off its `2d` eigenvalues.  And a difference of two positive
blocks, each below a multiple of `F`, is caught between the two multiples with
opposite signs — the centered block is never larger than either of its parts.

No cancellation is claimed: this is the crude bound, and the constant it
produces is the one the printed clause writes as `C_{d,Q}`.
