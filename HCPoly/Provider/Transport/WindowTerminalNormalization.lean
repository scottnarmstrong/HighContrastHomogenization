# The terminal mean, its comparison, and the bridged normalization

The terminal clause of `e.source.adapted.bound` compares the annealed block
of the terminal cell with the reference block from both sides,
`b_{\mathbf r}^{-1}𝐄_* ≤ F_0 ≤ b_{\mathbf r}𝐄` with
`b_{\mathbf r} = B_{\mathbf r}\E[Y_P]`
(`e.two.grid.source.normalization`), and reads the resulting
normalization `Λ(F_0;𝐄) ≤ κ_𝐄b_{\mathbf r}` and its bridged form
`Λ(F;𝐄) ≤ κ_𝐄b_{\mathbf r}/(1-η)`.

The upper comparison is the primal cell bound of the window integrated: the
expectation is monotone and the multiplier's mean is the printed factor.  The
lower comparison needs no operator Jensen once the sharp involution is
available.  The sharp reverses the Loewner order and is homogeneous of degree
minus one, so the upper comparison gives `b_{\mathbf r}^{-1}𝐄_* ≤ F_0^♯`; and the
annealed primal-adjoint order gives `F_0^♯ ≤ F_0`.  The
two together are the printed lower bound, and they also give positivity of
`F_0` a second time.

The normalization is then a change of reference block: the reference ratio
`κ_𝐄 = Λ(𝐄_*;𝐄)` is by definition the cost of
measuring `𝐄` against its own dual, and the lower comparison converts that into
the cost of measuring `𝐄` against `F_0`.  One more change of reference, by the
lower bridge, gives the bridged form; the upper bridge is not used.

The agreement of the primal and adjoint normalizations is an identity, not an
estimate: the reflection carries the defining set of one
scalar size onto the defining set of the other.
