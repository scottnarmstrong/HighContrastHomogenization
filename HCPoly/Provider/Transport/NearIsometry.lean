# The near-isometric comparison of the transport

This is the second half of the matrix calculation the proof of
`p.two.grid.transport` isolates and uses at every target cell.
The convex combination `P̄` of the previous module lives on the old grid; the
target cell lives on the new one, and the two normalizations differ by the
bridge congruence `S`.  The display `e.two.grid.whitney.mean.bound` says
that transporting `P̄` costs a factor depending only on `d` and `Q` plus one
*additive* multiple of the bridge error — the error never multiplies the gain.

The mechanism is the splitting
`S^tP̄S - I = S^t(P̄ - I)S + (S^tS - I)`.  The first term is positive and its
trace is at most `(1 + η)tr(P̄ - I)`; the second is bounded above by `η` times
the identity.  So the whole matrix is dominated by a positive matrix of trace at
most `(1 + η)tr(P̄ - I) + 2dη`, and the trace of a spectral positive part is at
most the trace of any positive matrix above it.

The passage from the trace bound to the gain bound is scalar and uses the
convexity of the gain twice: once to absorb the factor `1 + 2dη` into a
constant, and once to see the remaining `(1 + 2dη)^Q - 1` as a multiple of `η`.
