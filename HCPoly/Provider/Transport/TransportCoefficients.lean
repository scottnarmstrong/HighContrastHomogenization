# The transport source coefficients

The source residual the transport pays at a target level of the new grid is
measured by the two source coefficients of the transport estimate: the
continued one `𝖣_cont^{tr,𝒮}(q,q') = C_dK(q,q')κ_𝐄B_qB_{q'}χ_g𝒰²`, which the
old-times-new
orientation of the boundary rows produces, and the early one
`𝖣_early^{tr,𝒮}(q') = C_dκ_𝐄B_{q'}²𝒰²`, which the new-squared orientation of the
whole-cell rows produces.  The total coefficient
`𝖣_src^{tr,𝒮} = 1 + 𝖣_cont^{tr,𝒮} + 𝖣_early^{tr,𝒮}` is what the transported
source majorant is built from.

This file records the order relations between the three that every source
estimate reads.  Each factor of the two rows is nonnegative — the cross-grid
factor is at least one, the reference ratio is an infimum of nonnegative
numbers, the boundary constant is a nonnegative multiple of a square root, and
the geometric series `χ_g` is positive below the critical exponent — so the two
rows are nonnegative, the total is at least one, and it dominates each of them.
Without the last two the printed majorant would not majorize the printed rows
and the source estimate would be false as written.
