# Measurability of the normalized coarse-block excess

The rows of the annealed-to-quenched endgame
(`e.random.quenched.row`) are built from the normalized
excess of the coarse response over the homogenized block, maximized over the
standard cells centered inside an outer cube.  On the coefficient space the
coarse response is positive semidefinite, so its excess is the positive part of
the relative size already carried by the coarse-block measurability engine.  This
file records that identity and the two measurability statements it yields.
