# The mean block of a block-valued observable

The concentration estimate centres each observable at its own mean, so the
renormalization argument needs to compare the block of those means with the
annealed block.  The printed argument makes that comparison one-sided and free
of error terms: the truncated block is below the coarse block at every sample,
because the cutoff multiplies a positive block by a factor at most one, and the
mean is monotone.

This file records the block of entrywise means, identifies its quadratic form as
the average of the quadratic forms, and proves the monotonicity that the printed
argument uses.  The annealed block is the mean block of the coarse block, so the
comparison specializes to it.
