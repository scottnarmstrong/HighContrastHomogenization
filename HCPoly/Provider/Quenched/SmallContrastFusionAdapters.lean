# The fusion's remaining adapters, and the `∀ n` body fully assembled

Three numeric positions of the argument table (`hA1`, `hA2`, `hquad0`), the
entry position `hentry`, and what binds them remain.  This file closes the
three numeric positions once and for all by *naming* the
recursion constant, and assembles the whole `∀ n` binder body from the two
producers that are available on both sides:

* the squared-base weak-value bound supplies `hmaj` (its output is the
  hypothesis `hmaj`
  below, at `W = weakValueBase …`);
* `split_at_recursionAlpha_at_level` supplies `hWsplit` and `hwsq` — applied *inside*
  this file, so the caller never sees the split.

What is **not** closed here is `hentry`: it is carried as a hypothesis in
exactly the shape `hrec_line_of_one_step_isotropy_sharp_at_jb_src` consumes, at the named source group
`weakSourceGroupSummed M L (contrastRho g) vsum vmsrc bsrc`.  The rate-general
form of the entry lemma is provided, because the delay form asks for a decay
of rate one per generation in
`3 ^ (-(N₀ + n))`, whereas the source group's legs decay at the rooted rate
`(1 - contrastRho g)/2` in `H_w` and at the half rate in the lag `J`.
