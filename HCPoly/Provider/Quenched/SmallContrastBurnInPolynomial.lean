# The burn-in is polynomial in the telescope's base

The `hentry` clause of the isotropic-variance core body reads

```
(3 : ℝ) ^ (2 * N₀) ≤ base ^ Centry
```

with `base = 2 + aspectRatio Ebase * Kbase` and `Centry` chosen **before** the
law.'s `entry_exponent_of_burnIn` reduces it to a law-free exponent for
`3 ^ N₀` itself, and the burn-in `N₀` the endpoint uses is the bootstrap's
`N1 = sK + 1 + gap` (`HCPoly.Provider.Quenched.SmallContrastBurnInUniform`).

This file closes's table.  Its two one-line entries are

* `witnessEccentricity_one` — the identity witness has eccentricity one, so
  `boundaryConst Cd g 1` is `(d, g)`-only and `bootstrapAdapterFactor Cd g K E 1`
  loses its grid factor entirely;
* `rpow_le_self_of_one_le` — `(1 + K ^ 2) ^ g ≤ 1 + K ^ 2` for `g ≤ 1`, which is
  what removes the source gauge's fractional power.

With them, every factor of `3 ^ N1 = 3 ^ sK * 3 * 3 ^ gap` is under a power of
the base: `3 ^ sK` by `exists_source_scale_minimal` and
`growthBar_le_base`, `3 ^ gap` by `exists_gap_three_pow_le_minimal` and the polynomial bound on `bootstrapAdapterFactor` assembled here.
The law-free constants that remain — `CB`, `Cd`, `zetaG g`, `1 + 6 * sigma`,
`sigma⁻¹`, `3 ^ kZero d` — ride into the exponent through
`exists_rpow_ge_uniform`, which is admissible precisely because they are
fixed before `Ebase` and `Kbase`.

`sigma` is the endpoint's `cSc` step 6) and `CB`, `Cd` depend on `d` and
`g` alone, so `cburn` — and therefore `Cdelay` — is chosen at the binder's own
quantifier order.
