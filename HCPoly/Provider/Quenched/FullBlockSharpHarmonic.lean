# Harmonic means and the sharp involution

Conjugation by the doubled-block reflection turns the inverse of a sharp
matrix back into the original matrix.  Consequently, the harmonic mean of a
finite family of sharp matrices is exactly the sharp of the arithmetic mean
of the original family.  Combining this identity with order reversal gives
the lower comparison used in the quadratic fluctuation estimate.
