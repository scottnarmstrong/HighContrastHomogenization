# Endpoint-relative coefficient transport

The physical-scale coefficient used by the quenched row is the same quotient
pullback as the coefficient-space triadic dilation used to define the rebased
law.  This identifies endpoint-relative tail estimates under the mapped law
with their pullbacks to the original law.
