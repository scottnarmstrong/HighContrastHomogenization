# The normalized cell excess below the stopping radius

Below the stopping radius of a generation the window supplies a discounted
Loewner bound against that generation's reference block.  Comparing the
reference block with the homogenized block turns it into a bound on the
normalized excess, which is the quantity the weighted row of
`e.random.quenched.row` sums.  The comparison of the two
blocks is the only input this file does not prove.
