# The recursion line stated at its own base index

The original sharp line takes `hjb : 3 * n / 4 ≤ jb` and uses antitonicity to
deduce `F jb ≤ F (3 * n / 4)`; its conclusion is then
stated at the weaker index `3 * n / 4` and `jb` disappears.  That is exactly
right when the iteration runs from the origin, and exactly wrong when it runs
from an offset: a proportional index measured from the origin lags out of the
shifted clock, and no offset makes the two compatible.

Here each declaration concludes at `F jb`, the recurrence's chosen base index,
and asks instead the one
fact the quadratic step really needs, `jb ≤ n`, which the one-step family
already supplies as the upper half of `t - Hw ≤ jb ≤ t`.

At `jb = 3 * n / 4`, these statements specialize to the three-quarter-index
forms because `3 * n / 4 ≤ n`.

The base index may then lag inside the shifted clock,

```
jb n  :=  n₀ + 3 * (n - n₀) / 4 ,
```

whose three admissibility facts are proved at the end of the file: it dominates
`3 * n / 4`, it is bounded by `n`, and after the shift it
is the free index `3 * j / 4`, which satisfies the iteration lemma's
`j ≤ 2 * l' j + 1` at every `j`.
