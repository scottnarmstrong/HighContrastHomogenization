# Invariant full-measure events from almost-everywhere properties

An almost-everywhere property need not itself define a measurable set.  Its
failure set nevertheless has outer measure zero, hence admits a measurable
null superset.  The complement is a measurable full-measure subset on which
the property holds pointwise, and the integer-translation invariant core can
then be applied without any measurability hypothesis on the property.
