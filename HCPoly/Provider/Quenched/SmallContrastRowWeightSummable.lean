# Row weights: summability and the partition bound together

The relative-volume bound bounds the value of the row series but says
nothing about summability — in Mathlib `∑' f ≤ 1` holds of every unsummable `f`,
since an unsummable `tsum` is `0`.  Its consumer needs both: the burn split
replaces a dominating geometric series with a partition bound, and a partition
bound is not a domination, so summability has to come from somewhere else.

It comes from the same place the bound does — nonnegativity together with
uniformly bounded partial sums — and the partial sums are bounded because a
finite subfamily of a disjoint filling has total volume at most the parent's.
Both facts are recorded here, the first at the generality the bridge uses and
the second purely arithmetically.

/-- **Summability and the bound, from nonnegativity and bounded partial sums.**
This is the conjunction the burn split's consumer needs; the bound alone is not
enough, because an unsummable family satisfies it vacuously. -/
