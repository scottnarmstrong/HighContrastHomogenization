# The entry exponent

The only hypothesis of `hrec_final_sharp_at_jb_src` that is not an algebraic identity is the
entry-exponent condition

  `3 c_w u_n² ≤ δ (3^{-α})^n`,

where `u_n` is the source group of the weak base at the shifted generation
`n` (absolute generation `N₀ + n`).  The source group carries the bad-event
moment at the depth `Δ = N₀ + n + G - 1 - s_K`, so it decays *jointly* in the
entry delay `N₀` and in `n`:

  `u_n² ≤ C_src · 3^{-(N₀ + n)}`.

This file records the consequence: **any** `α ≤ 1` is admissible for the
source leg, the whole condition being met by a delay
`N₀ ≥ log₃(3 c_w C_src / δ)`.  Since the iteration decay separately caps
`α ≤ 1/2`, the exponent is fixed at

  `α := 1/2`,

and the entry threshold is the explicit delay below — law-polynomial,
because `C_src` is polynomial in `2 + aspectRatio 𝐄 · K` and the delay enters
only through its logarithm.

/-! ## The corrected exponents

`α = 1/2` is not admissible: the rooted drop slot of `weakValueSharpMajorant_le_three_group_summed_at_level`
carries the weight `3^{-(1/2 - ρ/2)j}`, and `exists_account_one_step_entry_of_block_at_level`
binds `g ≤ ρ < 1`, so that weight's rate is always `< 1/2`.  The consistent
choice pairs the two exponents:

  `ρ := (1 + g)/2`,   `α := (1 - g)/4`,

for which the rooted-drop rate `1/2 - ρ/2` and the window-tail rate
`(1 - ρ)/2` are *both* exactly `α`. -/

feeds a recursion at any rate `r₂ ≥ r₁`. -/
