# The drop history's head block, and what it costs the offset

The account's line producer states its drop history as
`iterationDropSum r F n` — a sum from the **original** origin `k = 1`.  The
offset iteration lemma asks for the history of the shifted sequence, a sum from
the offset.  The two differ by the head block `k ∈ (0, n₀]`, and the print's own
endgame writes its sum from `2 n₀`, so this is exactly the gap between what the
account produces and what the iteration consumes.

The head block costs one thing and it is cheap: every one of its weights is at
most `r ^ j`, its drops telescope, and the total is bounded by `F 0 · r ^ j`.
So the offset recursion holds with source constant

```
delta_offset  =  A · F 0  +  deltaRec ,
```

both summands law-free — `F 0` is the bootstrap floor and `A` is's law-free
recursion constant.  That is the same balance shape
the absolute scale constants already solve, with no delay factor and no
law-dependent inflation.

Both statements below are exact: `iterationDropSum_succ` is the sum's own
recurrence, and the offset bound is that recurrence applied twice, since the
shifted history obeys the identical one.
