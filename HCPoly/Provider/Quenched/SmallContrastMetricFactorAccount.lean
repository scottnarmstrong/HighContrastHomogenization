# The two metric factors of the sharp weak value, at the recentered reference

`weakValueBoundSharpIsotropyAt` carries two metric factors, both at the recentering
skew `h_0 = h_rsp(K_t)` of the terminal adapted mean:

* `K_{M,F_2}` at the inflated reference `F_2 = c_F 𝐄`;
* `K_{M,E_t}` at the terminal adapted mean itself.

This file bounds both by *reference data only* — no generation, no source
moment — once the reference has been recentered so that its canonical shear
vanishes (`SmallContrastCanonRecenter.canonicalShear_recentered_eq_zero`,
the normalization of Section 2.5 of HC) and the terminal mean is two-sidedly
comparable with the reference:

  `E_t ≤ c_F 𝐄`   (the entry envelope)     and   `𝐄 ≤ κ E_t`  (the entry
  comparability).

Under the recentering the canonical metric block of the reference *is* the
split metric `M_0 = diag(m(𝐄), m(𝐄)^{-1})`, so the balance chain
`M(𝐄) ≤ 𝐄 ≤ 𝔡(𝐄)^{1/2} M(𝐄)` turns the two comparabilities into a two-sided
comparison of `E_t` with `M_0`, which is exactly the input of
`responseSkew_quad_le_of_sandwich`.
