# Colour separation of the standard aligned cubes

The concentration-for-sums condition supplied by unit range of dependence is a
statement about a family of observables indexed by the standard aligned cubes
`z + □_n`, `z ∈ 3^n ℤ^d ∩ □_m`, of `e.coarse.ellipticity`.  Neighbouring
cubes of that family touch, so unit range does not apply to the family as a
whole.  It applies after a triadic colouring: two distinct cubes of the same
scale whose indices agree modulo three are separated in `ℓ^∞`-distance by more
than one, so the local sigma-fields they carry are independent.

This file records that geometry for the standard cubes, in the two forms the
concentration argument consumes: measurability of the cubes, and pairwise unit
separation of a same-colour family.  The colour classes need no new carrier: the
residue map `w ↦ (w i mod 3)_i` takes values in `(ZMod 3)^d`, and the partition
of a finite index family into its colour classes is the one already used by the
finite-range averaging estimate.
