# The slot algebra of the per-generation discharge

Two things the slot instantiation of needs, both purely algebraic.

**1. The supply value.**  `entry_lagged_variance_supply_of_block_split` delivers, at base `j_b`
and depth scale `p`, a value of the shape

  `dd · cN · ((2 + 4(1+c)²)·X + 4(1+c)²·36·(Y + Z) + c)`

with `c = 4d(Θ̂_{j_b} − Θ̂_p)` the mean drop, `X` the decayed subdivision term,
`Y = d(Θ̂_{j_b} − 1)` the base-scale excess and `Z = ½·3^{−(p−j_b)}`.  Under the
drop smallness `c ≤ 1` and `c ≤ 4Y`, this is at most

  `dd·cN·(18X + 576Z)  +  dd·cN·580·Y`,

i.e. exactly the `vsrc + cV·F(j_b)` shape the three-group split consumes.
The decay lives entirely in `X` and `Z`.

**2. The summed split.**  The uniform hypothesis `V j ≤ vsrc + cV·F(j_b)` of
`weakValueSharpMajorant_le_three_group_summed_at_level` is too coarse for the source group: a
*uniform* `vsrc` produces a source group that does not decay in the
generation, which is what stopped on.  The refined statement here takes
the hypothesis already summed against the linear weight,

  `∑_{j ≤ H_w} 3^{−j/2}(V j + V0) ≤ vsum + cVsum·F(j_b)`,

so that the depth structure — the deep legs carrying weight `3^{−j/2}` with
`j > t − j_b`, and the shallow legs carrying the subdivision decay
`3^{−d(p−j_b)/2}` — is visible in `vsum` and can decay with the generation.

**3. The recursion rate.** fixed `ρ = (1+g)/2` and the rooted-drop
weight `ν = (1−g)/4`.  The *recursion* rate must additionally beat the deep-leg
source rate, which is `3^{−J₀}` with `J₀ = n − ⌊3n/4⌋ ≥ n/4`; taking
`α_rec := (1−g)/16` gives `α_rec ≤ ν` (so the rooted conversion applies through
`iterationDropSum_mono_r`) and `α_rec ≤ 1/16 < 1/4` with strict room for the
deep-leg source.

The value is `(1−g)/16` and not `(1−g)/8`: at `(1−g)/8` the deep-leg
source rate `1/2` in the lag `J ≤ n/4` gives exactly `n/8` per generation, which
*equals* `α_rec` at `g = 0`, leaving no margin for the entry delay — the source
group can then only be fitted under `δ·3^{−α n}` by a pure constant inequality,
with no gain from the delayed start.  Halving `α_rec` opens a margin
`min((1+g)/8, 3(1−g)/8)·n`, strictly positive for every `g ∈ [0,1)`, so the
delayed start absorbs any `Π`-polynomial source constant.  The only cost is that
the endpoint rate `α_rec/(640·A)` halves, which is free: `alpha` is existential
in the frozen `hcore` binder.

/-- The recursion rate `α_rec = (1-g)/16`: a quarter of the rooted-drop rate, so
that it beats the deep-leg source rate `1/4` strictly *and* leaves a margin for
the entry delay at every `g ∈ [0,1)`. -/
