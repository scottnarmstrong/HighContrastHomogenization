# The recent average sums by per-scale variances

The weighted recent average sum of the weak-norm split is bounded in `L²(P)`
by the square roots of the same per-scale variance carriers and mean drops:
the normalized average defect is dominated pathwise by the average of the
per-cell normalized deviations (the operator norm of an average is at most
the average of the norms), whose first moments are the per-scale carriers by
the exponent comparison on the probability space.  This is the second
(aligned average) group of the printed display HC (3.68).
