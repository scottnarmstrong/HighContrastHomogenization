# The value clause at the line producer's pinned coefficients

The line producer reads the weak base at the pinned group coefficients; the
released weak value reports at coefficients that move with the split level.
This file names the normalizer that reconciles them, so the assembly can
supply the value clause without a producer of its own.

The normalizer is `(cfirst + cmax + 1) · M`, which is above `M` and dominates
both released coefficients after division by sixteen.  It is a choice, not an
estimate: every group of the base is linear in the normalizer and the
consumer's constant bundle asks only that it be nonnegative.
