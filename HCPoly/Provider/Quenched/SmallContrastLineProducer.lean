# `hline`: the per-generation producer at the sharp constant

The per-generation analytic estimate.

`hline` is *precisely* `hrec_line_of_slots_isotropy_sharp_at_jb_at_level_src`'s conclusion quantified
over `n ≥ ns` (the cited theorem).  the corresponding argument found no producer in
the construction: the account that would feed it was never built.  This file builds
it, in the two stages the corresponding argument separated.

**the corresponding step — the constants pack.**  Nine of the seventeen `n`-free hypotheses are
pure scalar side conditions on the slot constants.  `IsotropySlotConstants` bundles
them so the producer's binder stays readable, and the isotropic slot constants
are supplied from the exponent pack's `g`-clauses plus the four positivity facts
a caller already has.

**the corresponding step — the producer.**  `hline_of_slots_sharp_var_at_jb_at_level_src` takes the `n`-free data once
and the `n`-dependent slots as families over `n`, and discharges `∀ n ≥ ns` by
`hrec_line_of_slots_isotropy_sharp_at_jb_at_level_src` at each generation.

The carriers that must vary with the generation are exactly `V`, `V0`, `Dr`,
`Vmean`, `bmaj`, `wv` and `jb`; everything appearing in the recursion constant
or in the recursion tolerance — `cD`, `delta`, `cVsum`, `cVm`, `vsum`, `vmsrc`,
`bsrc` — is
`n`-free of necessity, since `fusionRecursionConstantIsotropySharp` and the geometric
term are fixed across the recursion.  That split is forced by the statement, not
chosen.
