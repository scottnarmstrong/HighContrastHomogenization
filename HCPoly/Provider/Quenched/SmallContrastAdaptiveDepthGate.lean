# The adaptive-depth gate: the family clause excludes the echo witness

The the stated witness is admissible for the FIXED-index construction.  The family
hypothesis at level-adapted lag supplies the recursion clause at every
within-octave pair `(n, m)`; on a plateau the drop history collapses
(the drop history is constant on a plateau), so once the memory has expired
(`A·ra^{n−b}·δ₀ ≤ λ/4`), the level is small (`A·λ ≤ 1/4`, automatic from
`A·δ₀ ≤ 1/2` by the echo-tower quarter bound), and the adapted-lag source is small
(`s ≤ λ/4`), the clause forces `λ ≤ (3/4)·λ` — false.  So the witness
VIOLATES the family clause at the middle generations of any sufficiently
long octave: the tower profile survives the fixed-index construction only, and
the condition's mechanism is not blocked by the corresponding clause.
