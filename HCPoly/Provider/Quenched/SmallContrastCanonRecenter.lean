# The one-time recentering of the reference: canonical data under a shear

Section 2.5 of HC records that
subtracting a constant skew matrix `h` from the coefficient field leaves the
solution space unchanged and conjugates every coarse block by the shear
`G_h`, leaving the two diagonal Schur coordinates untouched and subtracting
`h` from the Schur skew coordinate (HC (2.65)).  The paper uses this
to assume, without loss of generality, that the relevant homogenized skew
vanishes.

This file records what the same recentering does to the *canonical* data of
the reference block: the canonical metric `m(E)` is invariant and the
canonical shear `g(E)` drops by the recentering skew,

  `m(G_h^t E G_h) = m(E)`,   `g(G_h^t E G_h) = g(E) - h`.

Consequently the one-time recentering by `h := g(E)` produces a reference
whose canonical shear vanishes, which is the normalization under which the
weak-norm metric factor of the small-contrast estimate is controlled by the
reference's imbalance alone.

The proof is the congruence equivariance of the geometric mean together with
the shear covariance of the sharp involution (`fullBlockSharp_shear_conj`),
which is available exactly because the recentering matrix is skew.

`M(G_h^t E G_h) = G_h^t M(E) G_h`.  This is `matGeomMean_conj` composed with
the recentering identity `fullBlockSharp_shear_conj`, the covariance of the
primal-adjoint involution under a constant skew shear. -/
