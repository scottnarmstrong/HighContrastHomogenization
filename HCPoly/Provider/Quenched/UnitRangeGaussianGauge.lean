# The finite-range Gaussian gauge

A unit-range law satisfies the concentration-for-sums condition with the
dimensional parameters supplied by unit range of dependence: the exponents
`β = 0` and `ν = d/2`, the Gaussian concentration gauge
`Ψ_fr(t) = exp(c_fr(d) t²)`, and a dimensional growth
witness `K_fr(d) ∈ [3, ∞)`.

This file fixes those numbers and proves the two structural properties a gauge
must have before the weak-Orlicz calculus can use it: admissibility, that is
monotonicity on `[0, ∞)` together with the lower bound one, and the growth
inequality `t Ψ(t) ≤ Ψ(K t)` for `t ≥ 1`.

The value of `c_fr(d)` recorded here is the one the colouring argument produces.
A triadic colouring of the aligned cells uses `3^d` colours, each colour class
is independent under unit range, and the resulting sub-Gaussian parameter of a
sum of `N` bounded local observables is `3^d N`; the exponent constant is the
reciprocal `(2 · 3^d)⁻¹` that the Chernoff bound then supplies.  Every number
here depends on the dimension alone; none of them sees a law, a reference block,
a source scale or an exponent.
