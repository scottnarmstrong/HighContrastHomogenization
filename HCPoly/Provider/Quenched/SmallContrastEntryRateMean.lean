# The mean slot's source, and `hentry` at named constants

the corresponding argument.1 left one hole: `hVmeanle : Vmean ≤ vmsrc + cVm · F j_b` was consumed
everywhere and produced nowhere.  This file closes it from the construction's own
mean-slot machinery and instantiates the leg-bound entry estimate so that `hentry`
stands fully discharged at named constants.

**Where `Vmean` comes from.**  `entry_supply_mean_slot_bound_at`
(the cited theorem) converts the reference-normalized terminal
scale variance into the mean-normalized one:

  `scaleVariance P q (adaptedMean P q t) t ≤ ofReal (meanSlotConversion C_d g m_Al G_acc 𝐄 · V₀)`,

i.e. `Vmean ≤ conv · V₀` with `conv = meanSlotConversion …`.  The slot family
already bounds `V₀` — it *is* `slotFamilyValue d Csub Msc delta F(j_b) J 0`,
which is by definition `slotSourceSeq … J 0 + slotBaseCoefficient d · F(j_b)`.
So the mean slot splits into a source part and a base part with no new
estimate, only the conversion factor:

  `vmsrc = conv · slotSourceSeq d Csub Msc delta J 0`,
  `cVm   = conv · slotBaseCoefficient d`.

Its decay is the same `3^{-J/2}` as the variance leg, because
`slotSourceSeq … J 0 = slotSourceValue d Csub Msc J`.
