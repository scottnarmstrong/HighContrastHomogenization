# Threshold calibration for the quenched endgame

This is the numerical choice behind the small-contrast threshold of
`ss.algebraic.convergence`.  Once a
positive small-contrast threshold has been fixed, the two remaining
thresholds can be chosen before any exponent or probability law.

entry thresholds satisfying the endgame calibration. -/
