# The local block cutoff

The concentration estimate needs an observable that is bounded, local to its own
cell, below the coarse block at every sample, and equal to the coarse block on
the event that the source has burnt in.  The printed argument uses a smooth
spectral cutoff of the normalized block; the smoothness is there only to bound
the multiplicative derivative that the printed mixing hypothesis asks for, and
unit range supplies exact independence instead.

On this carrier the cutoff may therefore be taken to be the hard one that keeps
the block when all of its entries respect a threshold and discards it otherwise.
It is local, because the branch condition is a finite conjunction of conditions
on entries that are already known to be local; it is bounded by the threshold; it
is below the block at every sample, the discarded branch being the zero block and
the coarse block being positive; and the coarse-ellipticity datum makes the
branch condition hold on the burnt-in event, so nothing is discarded there.
