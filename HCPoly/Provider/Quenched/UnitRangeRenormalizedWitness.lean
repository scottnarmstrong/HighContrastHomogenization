# The coupled mixing-scale witness from the frozen carriers

The renormalization of ellipticity feeds the bad-tail engine with a
generation-indexed family of minimal scales whose shifted tail is the engine's
`hRtail` at the dimensional constant `c_fr(d)`.  Its only analytic input is the
single-cell estimate `HasCellRenormalization`, and that estimate is now a
theorem of the frozen carriers.

This file performs the substitution: the reference family is the annealed block
at the inner generation `n - l₀`, the exponents are `γ = g` and `ν = d/2`, and
the gain is the dimensional constant `renormGain`.  What is left of the
hypothesis list is the engine's own bookkeeping — the parameters of the window,
the buffer, the block decay and the normalizer — together with three arithmetic
side conditions on the window: the inner generation lies below the base
generation, the window is no higher than `l₀ + 1`, and the source tail at the
lowest inner generation is at most one half.
