# The bootstrap tilt bridge

The tilt scalarization reads a one-sided Loewner adapter error against the
reference block as a multiplicative comparison of intrinsic contrasts.  The
bootstrap consumes it in the Euclidean direction: the adapted mean on the
selection grid at generation `n` is compared with the annealed block of a
centered cube at a strictly earlier scale `k`, the cube being presented as the
adapted cell of the Euclidean rounded grid.

Two scalar inputs enter: the absorbed adapter size `η = c·|𝐄 : 𝐀(□_k)|` and
the Euclidean hatted defect `x = d(hatΘ_k − 1)`.  The output is the same
degree-two polynomial the scalarization produces, evaluated at any upper
bounds for those two — the hatted carrier of the adapted mean sits below its
intrinsic contrast, so the polynomial bounds the hatted defect on the
selection grid as well.
