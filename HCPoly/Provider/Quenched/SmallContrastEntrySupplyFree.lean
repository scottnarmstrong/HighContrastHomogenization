# The free-threshold entry supply

The corrected (s-free) analogue of `entry_lagged_variance_supply_of_block_split`: the
window-coupled moment availability `𝔪₂(K) ≤ 3^{jb+G-s_K}` is replaced by
the **burn-in condition** — the anchor sits deep enough past the growth
witness that the deepened moment excess `3^{-MΔ}·crude` is at most one,
for a free reserve order `M`.  Past the burn-in both deepened moments are
at most `2`, so the supply value is **`growthBar`-free**: the proved entry
conclusion with the crude moments replaced by the absolute constants `2`
and `√2`.  This is the free-threshold mechanism: the `K`-content leaves the
lag channel entirely and
is paid once, in the threshold, as the burn-in depth.
