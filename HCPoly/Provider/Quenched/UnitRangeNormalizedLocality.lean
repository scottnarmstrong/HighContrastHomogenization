# The normalized block: locality, entry bounds, positivity

The renormalization argument applies the concentration estimate to the entries of
the normalized coarse block.  Three properties of that block are needed before
the estimate can be used, and all three follow from the flattening
`toFullBlockMat (normalizedBlock H E) = E'^{-1/2} · toFullBlockMat H · E'^{-1/2}`.

Locality: each entry of the normalized block is a fixed finite linear
combination of the entries of the block itself, so it is measurable for the local
sigma-field of the cell.  Positivity: conjugation by an invertible symmetric
matrix preserves positive definiteness.  Entry bounds: a positive block below the
scaled identity has entries bounded by the scale, which is what makes the cutoff
of the previous file inactive on the burnt-in event.
