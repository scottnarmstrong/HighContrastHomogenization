# The powered finite-range gauge

The window mechanism reads the tail of a coarse-ellipticity datum against the
`μ`-powered Gaussian `exp(c t^(2μ))`, `μ = d/2 - g`, rather than against the
Gaussian itself.  This file records the corresponding powered form of the
finite-range gauge supplied by unit range of dependence,

`Ψ_fr^{(μ)}(t) = exp(c_fr(d) t^(2μ))`,

together with the two properties a gauge must have before it can appear in a
coarse-ellipticity datum: admissibility and the growth inequality, the latter at
a growth witness depending on the dimension and on `μ` alone.  Reading the
stopping-radius provider against this gauge makes its domination premise an
identity, so the shifted tail the bad-tail engine consumes holds with the
dimensional constant `c_fr(d)`.
