# The round arithmetic of the adaptive-depth descent

The descent at level-adapted lag proceeds in stages; this module collects the
four arithmetic facts those stages live on.

* `geometric_le_of_logb` — the generic threshold: a geometric term
  `C·3^{−rate·L}` sits below a positive target once `L` exceeds the
  explicit logarithm.  Instantiated twice downstream: the second error
  term `S_Π·3^{−2(ν−γ)·L}` at the level-adapted lag, and the drop-channel
  memory `A·δ₀·ra^T` at the stage length.
* the lag telescoping: when each stage at least
  doubles the level's logarithm, the SUM of the round lags is at most
  twice the final one.  The total threshold is therefore linear in
  `log₃ Π + log(1/λ_final)`, with no `loglog` accumulation: the round
  count enters only through the per-round constant factor.
* the first error term's absolute part:
  `S·3^{2(γ·L − k)} ≤ S·3^{−2(1−γ)k}` for any lag `L ≤ k`, hence below
  target for `k` past the explicit burn-in.
* the prefactor identity — the compounded per-stage constant `C^J`
  rewritten as `3^{J·log₃C}`, the form `hpref` absorbs (the stage count
  `J` is logarithmic in the total scale, so this is the polylog factor).
