# Measurability of the abstract quenched minimal scale

The abstract Chapter 5 stopping construction supplies the first generation after
which no bad event occurs, but its public API does not record measurability.  This
file proves measurability directly from measurability of the individual bad
events.  No additional stopping-scale definition is introduced.
