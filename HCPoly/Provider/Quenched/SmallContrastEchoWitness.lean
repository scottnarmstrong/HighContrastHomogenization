# The echo witness: the construction recursion admits a staircase solution

gate branch (c).  The two-component scheduler's below-range
echo re-excites, and the certificate is stronger than an envelope-class
kill: the construction's hypothesis set — the recursion at the preserved-lag
anchor `shiftedBaseIndex ns` available from `ns`, the a-priori floor, the
origin initial datum (the stated condition), antitonicity, and a source that
still exceeds the floor on the pre-base block — **admits an explicit
solution**, the echo witness, whose value on the `j`-th octave of the inverse
anchor orbit is the tower `echoTower (j+1) = A^(2^(j+1)-1)·δ₀^(2^(j+1))`.

The octaves stretch geometrically (`echoBoundary (j+1) − ns` is at least
`(4/3)^(j+1)` times the burn-in `m₀+1−ns`), so at the fixed octave `j₀`
with `(D+1)·3^(j₀) ≤ 4^(j₀)` the witness value is a law-free positive
constant while any target `M·3^(−mu·(n−T₀))` with `T₀ ≤ ns + D·(m₀+1−ns)`
is smaller once the burn-in is large, with the smallness threshold made
explicit by the logarithmic echo gap.  Hence
NO method consuming only the construction hypotheses — the late-start/original-
anchor two-component scheduler included — can conclude a law-free rate at
a linear threshold.  The first echo damps in magnitude (`δ₀ → A·δ₀²`),
exactly as the scheduler's design intuited; the tower records that the
demand at the octaves outruns the damping against any geometric target.
