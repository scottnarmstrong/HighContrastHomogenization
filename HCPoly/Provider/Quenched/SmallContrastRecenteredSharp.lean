# The recentered annealed block: Schur data and sharp order

Recentering the coefficient field by the constant skew `g` replaces the
annealed block by its shear congruence, whose Schur coordinate drops by `g`
while the two diagonal Schur data are unchanged.  The sharp order for the
recentered block follows from the pathwise toolkit at the recentered samples
and matrix Jensen — not from a congruence of the original sharp order, which
is false in general.

/-- **The sharp order for the recentered annealed block.**  The pathwise
positivity and pathwise sharp order hold at every sample, in particular at
the recentered samples; matrix Jensen then gives the annealed sharp order for
the recentered mean.  Both toolkit facts are theorems of the coarse-block
positivity module, so the only hypothesis on the law is integrability. -/
