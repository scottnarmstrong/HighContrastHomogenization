# At the matched threshold the good-set residue is zero, and the source leg stays geometric

The two machine questions the released level has to answer before it is worth
releasing anywhere.

**Does the residue vanish?**  The residue enters because the excess is taken
above a threshold *below* the maximum's own deterministic level: with the level
held at `1 / 2` and the almost-sure envelope at `R / 2`, the excess off the bad
event is bounded by `(R - 1) / 2` rather than by `0`, and its fourth power is
the constant summand of the scaled bad-moment majorant.  The vanishing of the
good-set excess below is the one line that changes when the threshold is
matched to the
envelope, and `lintegral_pow_eq_setLIntegral_of_matched_threshold` is its
consequence for the moment: **the good set contributes nothing at all**, so the
moment bound is the bad-set bound with no additive term.

**Does the source leg stay geometric?**  This is the residue's own
fail-closed requirement: nonnegativity of a replacement majorant is not enough,
it must admit the geometric leg in the shape the entry-slot clause reads.
`profileBadMajorantAt_badMoment_le` is that leg at the released level, and
the start bound is it at the account's own use site — the same shape as
the established pair, with one `Π`-polynomial factor `R` in front of a constant the
source slot already permits to be `Π`-polynomial.

/-! ## The residue vanishes at the matched threshold -/

/-- **The moment loses its constant summand.**  When the threshold is matched to
the good-set envelope, the excess vanishes off the bad set and the moment
integral is the bad set's alone — no residue is added. -/

/-! ## The source leg is still geometric -/

/-- **The geometric bad-event leg at the released level.**  The counterpart of
the profile bad-majorant moment bound, for the residue-free majorant
`R ^ 4 · badMomentMajorant`
at the matched threshold `(beta, lev) = (R / 2, R)`.  The rate is the printed
half rate, unchanged; the cost of the released level is the single factor `R`. -/
