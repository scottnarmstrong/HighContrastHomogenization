# The abstract variance split

The pathwise chain of Lemma 4.4 of HC as a pure matrix estimate: a positive
parent below the average of positive children, dominating its sharp, has
normalized distance to the terminal frame controlled by the children's
average fluctuation around the intermediate frame plus the sharp-gap and
dilation terms.  All anchors are abstract, so the estimate applies
unchanged at the recentered (hatted) objects, where the two frame-sensitive
scalar inputs are dischargeable.
