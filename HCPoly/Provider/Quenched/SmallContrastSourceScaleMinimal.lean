# The source scale, chosen minimally

The one factor that was not already a named lemma.

`exists_source_scale_minimal` produces some `sK` with `growthBar K ≤ 3 ^ sK`
above a prescribed floor, which is all the account needs.  `hentry` needs more:
it must know `3 ^ sK` is not *much larger* than `growthBar K`, because `3 ^ sK`
enters the burn-in `N1 = sK + 1 + gap` and `hentry` must convert `3 ^ N1` into a
**law-free** exponent on the base.  An unconstrained `sK` gives nothing.

The fix is the same `⌈log₃ ·⌉` device as `three_pow_ceil_logb_le`, in its
`ℤ`-ceiling form: taking `sK := max floor ⌈log₃ (growthBar K)⌉` gives both
bounds at once, and the floor costs only the factor `3 ^ floor`, which is
dimension-only because the endpoint's floor is `kZero d`.
