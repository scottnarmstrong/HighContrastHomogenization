# Phase 1: the account entry caps at a parametrized normalizing block

the block-parametrization construction the corresponding argument applied to `SmallContrastEntryCapsIsotropy`.  The mean-drop carrier
gets a parallel definition over the block and the envelope scalar; the established
`blockSize_meanDrop_le` it is built from is **already** fully parametric in both
(the cited theorem), so the substitution is exact.

The terminal envelope, which the established proof derived from the Dagger at the
inflated scalar, becomes the hypothesis `henvF`, and the **comparability
constant** — pinned to `kap2Value` in the established proof — becomes the parameter
`kapE`.  That last one is not cosmetic: `kapE` multiplies into the *load*
`loadScaleOfScalar cF kapE`, which feeds `L`, hence `A`, hence `alpha`.  Recipe
the corresponding argument exemption of `kap2Value` as a "supply value" holds only where it
multiplies the excess; in the load slot it is load-bearing, exactly as the corresponding argument
closing note warned ("the corresponding clause are load-bearing, not cosmetic") — the same factoring as
everywhere else on this wave.

`meanDrop2ValueIsotropy` carries **no** `rfl` hinge back to the unparametrized
mean-drop value: the two bodies agree syntactically, but deciding that requires
unfolding the inflated reference inside `blockSize`, which is prohibitively
expensive.  The
identification is not needed — nothing consumes it, and the established carrier is
untouched, so the wave stays additive without it.
