# Normalized coordinates and the Loewner order

The concentration estimate bounds the entries of a doubled block, and the
reassembly turns entrywise bounds into a Loewner bound against a reference block
dominating the identity form.  The renormalization argument needs the bound
against the reference block of the coarse-ellipticity datum instead, and that
block carries no coercivity constant.

The printed argument avoids the difficulty by working in normalized coordinates
throughout: it bounds the entries of the normalized block and reads the result
against the identity, which un-normalizes to the reference block.  This file
supplies the missing step, that conjugation by the square root of the reference
block preserves the Loewner order, and the entrywise consequence the
renormalization argument consumes.
