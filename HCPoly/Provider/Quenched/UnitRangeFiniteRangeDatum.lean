# The finite-range coarse-ellipticity datum

The Gaussian half of the quenched tail needs the stopping-radius family read
against the Gaussian concentration gauge supplied by unit range of dependence
rather than against the source gauge of `e.coarse.ellipticity`.  Everything
downstream of such a datum is already available; this file names the datum, shows
what it delivers, and records why it is a genuine additional input rather than a
consequence of the assumptions already carried.

The gauge of a coarse-ellipticity datum occurs in one clause only, the source
tail.  The other clauses are monotone in the source scale in the *unfavourable*
direction: enlarging the source scale preserves the discounted Loewner bound but
enlarges the upper-tail event, so it can only make the tail heavier.  A datum at a
stronger gauge carried by a larger source scale therefore forces the original
source scale to satisfy the stronger tail already.  That is the content of
the source-tail bound below, and it is why the finite-range datum is carried
here as a named hypothesis instead of being derived.

/-- **The discounted Loewner bound is monotone in the source scale.**  Enlarging
the source scale shrinks the event on which the bound is asserted, so the bound
is inherited. -/

/-- **The gauge-change interface.**  A coarse-ellipticity datum may be re-read
against any admissible gauge, at any source scale at least the original one, once
that scale's tail against the new gauge is supplied.  The tail is the only clause
that has to be re-proved. -/
