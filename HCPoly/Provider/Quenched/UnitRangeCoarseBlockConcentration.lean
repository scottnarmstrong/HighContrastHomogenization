# Concentration for the coarse block readouts

The observables the endgame averages are readouts of the coarse block response
of the standard aligned cubes of `e.coarse.ellipticity`.  Two properties are
needed before the concentration-for-sums estimate applies to them: each readout
must be measurable for the local sigma-field of its own cube, and it must be
bounded and centred.

Locality holds for every entry of the coarse block of a bounded open cell of
positive volume, so in particular on the standard aligned cubes.  Boundedness
does not: on the high-contrast coefficient class the coarse block is not
uniformly bounded, its size being controlled only through the reference block
and the source scale.  The estimate is therefore applied to the *truncated*
readout, exactly as the printed derivation of the concentration condition does:
a cutoff at a level `B` is applied first, the truncated readout is centred at its
own mean and normalized by its own range, and the resulting family satisfies the
hypotheses of the concentration estimate with dimensional constants.

The truncation level is a parameter of the statements below; nothing here fixes
it, and no dimensional constant depends on it.
