# Scale account for a fixed canonical grid

A fixed rounded grid whose witness eccentricity is bounded by the reference
aspect ratio fits in a dimensionally enlarged centered cube.  The enlargement
is linear in the logarithmic reference scale, so a fixed four-generation
response lag fits inside a coupled source window with a dimensional execution
coefficient.
