# Constant-skew invariance of nonlinear histories and drift

Common shear congruence preserves the trace of a relative mean, determinant
increments, and the inverse-times-increment trace used by the fixed-grid
drift.  These identities complete the passage between hatted terminal data
and the portable histories.
