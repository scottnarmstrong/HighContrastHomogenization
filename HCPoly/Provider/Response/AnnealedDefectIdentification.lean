# The cellwise defects and the response defect

The defect half of a cutoff-defect mean row consumes a family of cell defects
whose normalized average is twice the response defect.  The response defect is
defined as the expectation of a difference of two responses, while the cellwise
data arrives as a difference of two expectations; the two agree once both
responses are integrable.

This module records that identification, the normalized average that follows
from it, and the nonnegativity of each cell defect in the same literal form.
The geometry of the cells enters only through the hypothesis that every cell
carries the same annealed response, which is what the alignment of the grid
supplies.
