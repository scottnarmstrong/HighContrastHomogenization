# The gradient field of the adapted cutoff

The div-curl estimate reads a cutoff through its gradient field: it needs that
field to be essentially bounded on the cube, to have smooth components, and to
have a bounded componentwise derivative.  The adapted cutoff carries instead a
bound for its first derivative and a bound for its second iterated derivative,
so the componentwise derivative of the gradient field has to be recovered from
the second iterated derivative.

This module performs that recovery in adapted coordinates and reads off the
three cutoff data of the div-curl estimate with one common dimension-only
coefficient.  The reference-cube div-curl coefficient then loses both of its
free parameters.
