# The terminal defects, the energy chain, and the absolute closure

The remaining displays of the response-load calibration:

* the energy chain `0 ≤ 𝔼[J_t^±] = ½(L_t^±)² - 1 ≤ ½(L_t^±)² ≤ 2√θ`, proved
  through the Schur form `e.annealed.schur`;
* the terminal defects `0 ≤ τ_{t,s}^± ≤ 2(ϱ^d - 1)√θ`;
* the two consequences of terminal-profile compatibility,
  `𝒲_t^⋄ ≤ (ℛ_t^⋄)²` and `ℒ_s^⋄ ≤ 2Γ𝒬_s^⋄ ≤ 16Γc_εβ√κ_s(√κ_t+1)√θ`, proved
  from the Loewner sandwich produced by a determinant loss;
* the norm identity `|S_*^{-1/2}BS_*^{-1/2} - Id| = θ - 1`;
* the factor-`12d` chain `κ_t - 1 ≤ 6(θ-1) ≤ 12d sup(...)`;
* the absolute closure: under `sup(...) ≤ ωκ_s` and the strict numerical
  inequality `12dωϱ^{2d}(1 + δ_ad⁻¹) < 1`, the imbalance closes at
  `κ_t - 1 ≤ δ_ad`.

The three probabilistic inputs — the annealed energy identity
`𝔼[J_t^±] = ½(L_t^±)² - p·q^±`, its nonnegativity, and the corrected absolute
response estimate `θ - 1 ≤ 2d sup(...)` — belong to the corrected-response and
profile layers and are carried here in their printed shapes.  Everything else
is proved.

/-- **The energy chain** `0 ≤ 𝔼[J_t^±] = ½(L_t^±)² - 1 ≤ ½(L_t^±)² ≤ 2√θ`.  The identity and the nonnegativity are the printed annealed
inputs; the final bound is the load bound. -/

/-! ## The congruent terminal defects -/

/-- **The terminal defects** `0 ≤ τ_{t,s}^± ≤ 2(ϱ^d - 1)√θ`.
The two hypotheses are the congruated forms of `E_t ≤ E_s` and of the
determinant-loss comparison `E_s ≤ ϱ^d E_t`. -/
