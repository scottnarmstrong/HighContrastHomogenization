# Scalar invariants of constant-skew congruence

The lower triangular shear is invertible.  A common congruence by this shear
therefore preserves the doubled Loewner order and the two scalar sizes used by
the response profile.  Normalization is also recorded as a linear operation,
which lets the recent averaged defect be handled without choosing an
orthogonal representative of the congruence.
