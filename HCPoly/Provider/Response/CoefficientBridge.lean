# The coefficient of a sample on an adapted cell

The variational layer of Armstrong–Kuusi Chapter 2 reads a coefficient field through the
domain-local interface `Book.Ch02.CoeffOn U`: a representative together with a
pair of ellipticity constants valid almost everywhere on `U`.  The high-contrast
paper instead carries a sample `a` of the coefficient law, an almost everywhere
class, and reads its coarse block response `𝐀(U; a)`, the variational coarse
block of `s.introduction`, through the variational block matrix of the class.
This file connects the two.

The connection is uniform in the domain, and that is what makes it usable on a
subdivision.  A sample has a measurable representative that is elliptic at
*every* point, and such a field is a Chapter 2 coefficient on every domain at
once, with the same representative and the same constants; so the parent cell
`U_t = q□_t` and all of its aligned children `U_k(z) = z + q□_k` may be equipped
simultaneously, each child coefficient being literally the restriction of the
parent one.  On each of them the Chapter 2 coarse block matrix is the paper's
own coarse block response: for the aligned cells this is the adapted response
`A_k(z) = 𝐀(U_k(z); a)` of the child cell.
