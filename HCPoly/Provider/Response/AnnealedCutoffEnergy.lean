# The annealed cutoff-energy estimate

The samplewise cutoff-energy estimate keeps the cutoff-weighted child responses
inside the absolute value, because for a single coefficient sample they do not
vanish.  Averaging over a translation invariant law removes them, and what is
left is an estimate for the expectation of the cutoff-weighted energy defect
alone.

This module performs that average.  The expectation of the correction is zero
by the annealed vanishing; the remaining composition is a mean-zero correction
combinator, so the only additional inputs are integrability hypotheses and one
equality saying that the reference coefficient family represents the sample.
The right-hand side is then reduced to expectations of the response, the
partition defect, and the difference energy by an integral form of the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
