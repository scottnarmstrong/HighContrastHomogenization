# The gradient scale of the adapted cutoff

The adapted cutoff is the canonical smooth product cutoff between two
concentric reference cubes of relative radii `1 - 1/(2d)` and `1 - 1/(4d)`,
normalized to have reference mean one and pulled forward by the grid matrix.

Two quantitative facts about that construction are recorded here.

* Its normalizing average is at most one, because the unnormalized product
  cutoff is bounded by one.  Consequently the normalized cutoff takes a value
  at least one on the inner cube and vanishes off the outer cube, and a
  one-dimensional mean value argument along a coordinate segment produces a
  point at which the adapted-coordinate gradient is at least the reciprocal
  collar width `8d·3^{-t}`.  Since `4(d+1) < 8d` whenever `d ≥ 2`, no bound of
  the form `‖q∇φ‖ ≤ 4(d+1)·3^{-t}` can hold for this cutoff.
* In the opposite direction the same construction obeys the sharper first
  derivative bound with coefficient `32 d² θ'`, where `θ'` is the derivative
  bound of the one-dimensional transition profile.  This is the smallest
  coefficient the construction supports; the coefficient recorded downstream is
  the common second-order enlargement of it.
