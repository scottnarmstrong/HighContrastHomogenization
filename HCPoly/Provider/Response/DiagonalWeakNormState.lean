# Optimizer states for the diagonal weak estimate

The diagonal weak estimate is stated for the canonical response optimizer of a
coefficient sample on an adapted parent cell.  This file turns that description
into a source-facing object: a sample is restricted to the parent domain, the
public canonical maximizer is selected, and its gradient and flux form the
doubled state.  Its energy is the square root of the normalized variational
energy.

The adjoint sample is also constructed on the a.e.-quotient coefficient space.
Its domain-local coefficient is a.e. equal to the transpose of the original
domain-local coefficient, so the Chapter 2 transpose congruence applies without
choosing an additional representative.
