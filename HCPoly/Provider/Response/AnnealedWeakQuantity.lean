# The annealed weak quantities as integrals of samplewise majorants

The weak quantities of the profile are squared `L²` norms of samplewise weak
seminorms.  A samplewise estimate for a term of the response split therefore
has to be turned into an estimate for the expectation of that term, and its
samplewise majorant has to be recognized as the integrand whose integral is the
weak quantity.

Both steps are recorded here.  The squared `L²` norm of an extended-nonnegative
observable is the integral of its square, which identifies the weak quantities
with integrals of the squared weak roots; and the expectation of a real
observable is dominated by the integral of its samplewise majorant, which is the
Jensen step.  Nothing about the geometry of the weak seminorm is used.
