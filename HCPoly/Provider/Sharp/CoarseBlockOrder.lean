# The pathwise block bounds of the coarse response

The elementary bounds for the coarse block (`s.introduction`) assert the sharp
order `𝐀^♯(U) ≤ 𝐀(U)` along every realization of the coefficient field.  By the reduction of `ReflectionOrder` this
is the pair of signed reflection bounds `±R ≤ 𝐀(U)`, that is, the pair of scalar
inequalities

  `± P₁ · P₂ ≤ ½ P · 𝐀(U) P`

over doubled vectors `P = (P₁, P₂)`.  Both are the same variational statement
about the coarse energy `μ(U; P)` whose Hessian `𝐀(U)` is: the pointwise Young
inequality on the doubled coefficient matrix bounds the block energy density
below by the pairing of the potential and flux fields, and that pairing averages
to `P₁ · P₂` because the potential correction is a gradient of zero trace and the
flux correction is solenoidal of zero normal trace — the div-curl cancellation.

Only the first sign has to be quoted: the second is the first read on the adjoint
field, since flipping the flux half of a doubled vector and transposing the
coefficient field leaves the coarse energy invariant and reverses the pairing.

The identification of `μ(U; ·)` with the quadratic form of the coarse block
matrix holds over every bounded open convex domain, not only over cubes; it comes
from the canonical recovery data of the variational problem, exactly as the
subadditivity of the response does.

The conclusion is unconditional along the coefficient space: the sample field
only enters through a measurable pointwise uniformly elliptic representative,
which every member of the class has, and the coarse response only sees the almost
everywhere class of the field.
