# The constant identity coefficient field as a point of `CoeffSpace`

This module checks the definition `CoeffSpace` of the coefficient space of
`s.introduction` at its reference point `constIdentity`, through the field
`identityField` and the translation `translateCoeff` that the point must respect.

Were the check to fail, the coefficient space would lose its exhibited point:
the class `CoeffSpace d` would be empty, the Dirac witness law of
`HCPoly.Annealed.Witness` could not be formed, and the hypothesis set of
`t.polynomial.entry` — a probability law that is stationary, of unit range and
coarsely elliptic — would be left without a model and its conclusion vacuous.  A
failure of `translateCoeff_constIdentity` would put the witness law outside the
translation-invariant class `s.introduction` prints, and a failure of
`coeFn_identityField` would make the field, as an a.e. class, something other
than the identity matrix.

This module is a consistency check of that definition and is not a result of the
paper.

The reference point of the coefficient space of `s.introduction`: the
field whose value is the identity matrix almost everywhere.  It is uniformly
elliptic with both ellipticity constants equal to one, and it is fixed by every
integer translation of the coefficient space.
