# Finiteness of the competitor energies: the coarse response is an honest infimum

This module checks the definition of the coarse block response: the paper's
`𝐀(U; a)`, in Lean the sampling response `coarseBlock U a`, is computed from the
variational quantity `Mu U Q a`, the infimum over the admissible states `X` of
the competitor averages `volumeAverage U (blockEnergyDensity a X)`.

That average carries a junk value on non-integrable integrands.  Were the check
to fail, an admissible competitor could leave the block energy density
non-integrable, the Bochner integral would return its junk value, and the
infimum defining `Mu` — hence the response `𝐀(U; a)` — would be `0` for a
reason unrelated to the field, not the paper's variational value.  The
positive-definiteness statements written for the response, among them the
well-formedness the annealed contrast `Θ_m` of `e.Theta.m` presupposes, would
then be statements about a different object.

This module is a consistency check of that definition and is not a result of the
paper.

This file removes the junk branch from the definition: on every bounded
measurable cell, *every* admissible competitor of the coarse variational problem
has finite energy, for *every* field of the coefficient space.

The mechanism is the local uniform ellipticity built into the coefficient space.
A sample field has a measurable representative that is uniformly elliptic at
every point of the cell, with the constants the cell's boundedness supplies; the
deterministic theory turns admissibility into the energy-integrability package
for that representative, and the energy density only sees the almost everywhere
class of the field.  Consequently the junk value of the Bochner average is never
attained and `𝐀(U; a)` is the honest infimum of the energy over the admissible
class.
