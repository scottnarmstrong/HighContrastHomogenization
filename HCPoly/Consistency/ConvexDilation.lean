# Dilation of a convex domain, and global smooth realization

This module checks the defining predicate `MemH1a` of `H¹_a(V)` of
`s.introduction`, and its zero-trace variant `MemH1a0`.  It checks the requirement in those classes that a member be approximated in the
`H¹_a` norm by functions smooth on all of `ℝ^d`, where the paper's
coefficient-weighted spaces are completions of `C^∞(U)`, the functions smooth
*on* `U`: a function smooth on `U` is carried, by dilation and a cutoff, to a
globally smooth function agreeing with its dilate exactly on `closure U`, and
exact agreement on an open set makes the two share their coordinate gradients.

Were that check to fail — were the homothety of `closure U` not to land in
`interior U`, or the dilate not to have a globally smooth representative
agreeing with it exactly on `closure U` with the same coordinate gradients —
then the printed completions could not be represented by the globally smooth
approximants that `MemH1a` demands; the predicate would encode a class smaller
than the space the paper prints, and every statement that assumes a member of
`MemH1a`, among them the estimates for weak solutions, would be vacuous
precisely where the paper means it to apply.  This module is a consistency
check of that definition and is not a result of the paper.

The classical route between the two dilates the domain and then mollifies the
function.  This module supplies the dilation step and removes the need for the
mollification.

The first section is the geometric core: for a convex `U` carrying an interior
ball around `c`, the homothety `x ↦ c + lam • (x - c)` of ratio `lam < 1` maps
`closure U` into `interior U`, so a function smooth on `U` becomes, after
dilation, smooth on an *open* set containing `closure U`.  Neither boundedness
nor openness of `U` is used; the interior ball is the only nondegeneracy input.

The second section replaces mollification.  Because the dilate is smooth on an
open neighbourhood of `closure U`, a smooth Urysohn cutoff turns it into a
genuinely globally smooth function agreeing with it *exactly* on `closure U`,
not merely approximately, and exact agreement on an open set transfers to the
coordinate gradients.

One classical, coefficient-free statement is not settled here: that dilation is
continuous at `lam = 1` in `L¹(U) × L²(U)`.  Until it is available the membership
classes used here are not known to agree with the printed completions, in either
direction.

/-! ## The convex dilation lemma

For a convex `U` carrying an interior ball around `c`, the homothety
`x ↦ c + lam • (x - c)` of ratio `lam < 1` centred at `c` pulls the whole closure
strictly inside: its image lands in `interior U`.  No boundedness of `U` and no
openness of `U` is used; the interior ball is the only nondegeneracy input. -/

/-- **The convex dilation lemma.**  If `U` is convex and contains the ball of
radius `ρ > 0` about `c`, then for every ratio `lam ∈ [0, 1)` the homothety
`x ↦ c + lam • (x - c)` maps `closure U` into `interior U`. -/

/-! ## The mollification step is unnecessary

The classical route to the density converse dilates and then *mollifies*, and
mollification in `L²` is the expensive part: the ambient library carries no
`Lp`-convergence statement for mollifiers.  It is not needed here.  Because the
previous section delivers smoothness on an *open* set containing `closure U`, a smooth Urysohn
cutoff turns the dilate into a genuinely globally smooth function that agrees
with it *exactly* on `closure U`, not merely approximately.  The cutoff is
`exists_contMDiffMap_zero_one_nhds_of_isClosed` read through `contMDiff_iff_contDiff`
for the model `modelWithCornersSelf ℝ (Vec d)`. -/

/-- **Global smooth realization.**  A function smooth on an open `S` is realized
*exactly* on any closed `K ⊆ S` by a function smooth on all of `ℝ^d`.  This is
the step that replaces mollification. -/

/-- **The two sections combined.**  On a convex `U` with an interior ball, a function
smooth on `U` alone has a dilate that is realized on all of `closure U` by a
globally smooth function.  No mollification, no `Lp` convergence, no
approximation: the agreement is exact. -/

    (contDiffOn_comp_dilate hv)

/-- Exact agreement on an open set transfers to the coordinate gradients, so the
realization of the previous theorem has the *same* `smoothGrad` as the dilate
throughout `U`.  Both summands of `h1sNormSqOn` therefore see the globally
smooth `g` and the dilate `v ∘ T` as the same object on `U`. -/
