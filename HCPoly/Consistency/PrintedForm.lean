# The intrinsic contrast and `Λ_0` in exactly their printed form

This module checks the definitions `blockContrast` and `bigLambdaRef`, together
with the derived constants `lambdaRef` and `aspectRatio`: the development's
encodings of the intrinsic contrast, the reference constant `Λ_0`, the reciprocal
`λ_0`, and the aspect ratio `Π` of `e.Theta.m` and `e.reference.aspect.ratio`.

If that check failed, those encodings would be infima of Loewner scalings with
nothing tying them to the objects the reference text prints, and the mismatch
would propagate through the development.  The intrinsic contrast `blockContrast`
could read `0` for a reason unrelated to the block, so the annealed contrast
`annealedContrast` of `e.Theta.m` would not be the paper's `Θ_m`, and the
conclusion `annealedContrast P mEnt - 1 ≤ δ` of `p.response.transfer` would
constrain the wrong quantity and could hold vacuously; the aspect ratio
`aspectRatio` would be the quotient of two quantities the paper does not name, so
the `Π`-bounds of `t.polynomial.entry` would bound the wrong constant.

This module is a consistency check of those definitions and is not a result of
the paper.  The reference text defines the intrinsic contrast and the reference
constant `Λ_0` as *minima over skew matrices of spectral norms*, while the
encodings are infima of Loewner scalings.  Three separate facts are needed to
identify the two readings, and all three are available on a symmetric positive
definite doubled block matrix:

* the Loewner-scaling infimum is the infimum of the family of conjugated norms;
* that infimum is attained, so it is a minimum;
* the members of the family are spectral norms, because the conjugated
  skew-corrected Schur form is symmetric positive semidefinite.

This file composes them, so that the encodings are stated to be the printed
objects with nothing left implicit.
