# The qualitative coefficient class

This module checks the definition `CoeffSpace d` of the development: that the
locally uniformly elliptic fields it collects do satisfy the qualitative
integrability condition `e.qualitative.ellipticity` of `s.introduction`, here
encoded by `IsQualitativeEllipticField`.  Were the check to fail, that class
would contain none of the coefficient fields the development works with, the
hypotheses of the paper's printed statements would have no instance here, and
those statements would be vacuous on the coefficient space this development
uses: the encoding would not be the object the paper prints.

This module is a consistency check of that definition and is not a result of
the paper.

The reference text takes as its coefficient space the measurable fields
`a : ℝ^d → ℝ^{d×d}` whose symmetric part `s` is positive definite almost
everywhere and which satisfy the qualitative integrability condition
`e.qualitative.ellipticity`: writing `k` for the skew-symmetric part, the
three matrix fields

```
s,      s⁻¹,      kᵗ s⁻¹ k
```

are locally integrable, entry by entry.

The class used in this development, `AEUniformlyEllipticField`, is narrower: it
asks that almost every value of the field on a bounded set be uniformly elliptic,
for a pair of ellipticity constants attached to the field and to the set.  This
file shows that the narrower class is contained in the qualitative one, which is
the implication asserted wherever the coefficient class is introduced.

Both halves are quantitative consequences of `IsEllipticMatrix`, read on one
bounded set at a time.  Coercivity of the values gives coercivity of the
symmetric parts, hence positive definiteness on every ball and so, the balls
exhausting `ℝ^d`, almost everywhere.  The entry bounds `|a i j| ≤ Λ` and
`|(s)⁻¹ i j| ≤ λ⁻¹` make each of the three fields essentially bounded entry by
entry on every bounded set, and a measurable function bounded almost everywhere
on every compact set is locally integrable for the Lebesgue measure.
