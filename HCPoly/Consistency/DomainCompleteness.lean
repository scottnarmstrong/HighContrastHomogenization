# The domain class of the Dirichlet estimate, from the other side

This module checks the shape datum `HasBallSandwich` through which the Dirichlet
estimate `e.random.dirichlet` reads the domain on which it is stated, and its
agreement with the paper's class `IsOpenBoundedConvexDomain`.
`exists_domain_with_ballSandwich` exhibits domains carrying a prescribed ball
sandwich; this module is the converse: every nonempty bounded open convex
domain admits one.  Together the two pin the class of domains the estimate
covers through its shape datum: it is exactly the class of nonempty bounded
open convex domains, no wider and no narrower.

Were that converse to fail, some nonempty bounded open convex domain would admit
no ball sandwich; the estimate's shape hypothesis would then be unsatisfiable on
that domain, so `e.random.dirichlet` — and every statement carrying the same
hypotheses — would be vacuous precisely where the paper means it to apply, and
the encoding `HasBallSandwich` would not be the domain class the paper prints.
This module is a consistency check of that definition and is not a result of the
paper.

The inner radius comes from openness at any point of the domain, the outer one
from boundedness, and the Euclidean ball of the second is obtained from the
coordinate bound by summing `d` squares.
