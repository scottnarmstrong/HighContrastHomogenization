# From the printed form of `t.polynomial.entry` to the calibrated form

The theorem `t.polynomial.entry` is printed as a statement about *every* scale
beyond the entry scale: for a tolerance `σ ∈ (0, 1]` there is a constant `C` with
`Θ_m ≤ 1 + σ` for every `m ≥ ⌈C log₃(2 + Π K)⌉`.  The consumers of the theorem in
the proofs of `t.algebraic.convergence` and `t.random.homogenization` use it in a
calibrated form instead: a tolerance `c_*` below both members of a calibration
pair `(c_sc, c_end)`, and a single entry generation `m_ent` exhibited as a
natural number, bounded by the printed ceiling and with `3^{m_ent}` polynomial in
`2 + Π K`.

This module derives the second from the first.  Three steps are involved.

* **The tolerance.**  `c_* := min 1 (min c_sc c_end)` is positive, lies below both
  members of the calibration pair, and is admissible as a tolerance in the
  printed statement, which requires `σ ≤ 1`.
* **The entry generation.**  The printed statement quantifies over all scales
  above `⌈C log₃(2 + Π K)⌉`.  That ceiling is positive, because `Π ≥ 0` and
  `K > 1` make `2 + Π K` exceed one and `C` is positive, so
  `m_ent := ⌈C log₃(2 + Π K)⌉` is a natural number and is itself an admissible
  scale.
* **The length bound.**  `⌈x⌉ < x + 1` turns the ceiling into the printed
  polynomial bound: `3^{m_ent} ≤ 3^{x+1} = 3 · 3^{C log₃(2 + Π K)} =
  3 (2 + Π K)^C`.

The assumptions `e.stationarity`, `e.unit.range` and `e.coarse.ellipticity` are
the ones the printed statement carries: `HCPoly.Frozen.IsStationaryLaw`,
`HCPoly.Frozen.IsUnitRangeLaw` and `HCPoly.Frozen.CoarseEllipticityDagger`, read
by the proofs of the propositions under their project-namespace names.  Nothing
is converted here.
