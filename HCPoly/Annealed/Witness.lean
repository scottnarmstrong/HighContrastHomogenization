# The hypothesis set of the random-source theorems is satisfiable

`t.polynomial.entry` quantifies over laws that are stationary under integer
translations, have unit range of dependence, and satisfy the coarse ellipticity
condition `e.coarse.ellipticity`.  Nothing in those statements exhibits a law
that satisfies all three, so on their own they
leave open the possibility that the hypothesis set is empty and the conclusion
vacuous.  This file closes that possibility with an explicit law.

The witness is the Dirac law at the constant identity coefficient field, with
source scale identically zero, gauge `Ψ(t) = e^t`, growth witness `K = 2`,
reference block `(4d+1)` times the doubled identity, and discount exponent
`g = 0`.  Stationarity holds because the constant field is fixed by integer
translation; independence holds because under an atomic law every pair of
events is independent; the source tail is trivial because the upper tail events
of the zero source at positive levels are empty; and the coarse domination is
the scale-uniform bound of the constant field, which needs no discount factor.

The Dirac law also carries the measurability of the coarse response, which
`e.Theta.m` presupposes for `Θ_m`.
