# The rescaled coefficient field is locally uniformly elliptic

The Dirichlet estimate `e.random.dirichlet`
is read for the rescaled field `a^ε(x) = a(x/ε)`, and every closure statement
about a weak-gradient pair needs an ellipticity pair for the field it is applied
to on the bounded set it is read on.

The route is the one `HCPoly.Setup.CoefficientSpace` takes for
`translateField`: the transport map is quasi measure preserving for the Lebesgue
measure, so almost-everywhere statements pull back along it.  There the map is a
translation and the input is `MeasurePreserving.quasiMeasurePreserving`; here it
is the dilation `x ↦ ε⁻¹ • x`, which is *not* measure preserving but is quasi
measure preserving — its pushforward is a finite nonzero multiple of the
Lebesgue measure — and the input is
`MeasureTheory.Measure.quasiMeasurePreserving_smul`, available because `volume`
on `Fin d → ℝ` is an additive Haar measure.  The dilation moves no value of `a`,
only where it is read: the ball of radius `R` for `a^ε` is served by the
constants of `a` on the ball of radius `R/ε`.
