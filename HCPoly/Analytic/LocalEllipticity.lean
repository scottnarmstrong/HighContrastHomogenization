# Reading the local ellipticity constants on one set

The coefficient class fixed in `s.introduction` is local: a field of the class
carries a pair of ellipticity constants on each bounded set, and the pair belongs
to the set.  Every estimate of the coefficient-Sobolev classes is an estimate on
one ball, one cube or one compact set, and each of them wants its hypothesis in
the shape `∀ᵐ x ∂volume.restrict V, IsEllipticMatrix lam Lam (b x)`.

This module converts the class into that shape: on a bounded measurable set, on a
centered Euclidean ball, and on a compact set.  The three statements are the same
extraction read at the three carriers the classes use.
