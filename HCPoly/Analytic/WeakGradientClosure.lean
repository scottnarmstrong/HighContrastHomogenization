# The weak-gradient relation is an identity between convergent integrals

`HasWeakGradientOn U u Du` compares two Bochner integrals.  A Bochner integral
of a non-integrable integrand is `0`, so a pair whose pairings all diverge
satisfies the relation as `0 = -0`, saying nothing.  The disposition taken here
is not to change the relation but to prove that this branch is unreachable on
the classes the homogenization theorem actually reads: for a member of
`H¹_{s,loc}(ℝ^d)` and a local test on a centred ball, **both** pairings converge
absolutely, so the relation is an identity between genuine integrals.

The hypotheses used are exactly the coefficient class hypotheses `0 < lam` and
almost-everywhere ellipticity, the measurability of the pair, and membership in
the local class.  The ellipticity assumption is **not** removable: on a field
that vanishes identically every weighted energy vanishes, and the class then
constrains the gradient field by nothing beyond measurability.  At the places
`t.random.homogenization` reads these classes the field is
a member of the coefficient space, whose defining condition supplies exactly
those two hypotheses; the class-level wrappers at the end of the module state
the results in that form.

The final group of lemmas records what the measurability condition of the class
buys.  A function invisible to both the lower Lebesgue integral and the Bochner
integrals lands in the class with zero weak gradient whatever its measurability;
with the measurability condition present the same construction is degenerate,
producing only the zero function.  Whether the wider class without that
condition is strictly wider is a question about sets of inner measure zero and
is not settled here: the possibility that the two classes coincide is not ruled
out, so the construction below may be vacuous.

/-! ## Absolute convergence of both pairings -/

/-- **The closure lemma.**  For a pair of the local class and a local test on a
centred ball, **both** pairings of the weak-gradient relation are absolutely
convergent.  The branch valuing a non-integrable integrand at `0` is therefore
unreachable on this class.

Hypotheses used, in full: local uniform ellipticity of the coefficient field,
whose constants are read on the ball; almost everywhere strong measurability of
`v` and of the components of `Dv` on the ball; membership in `MemH1sLoc`; and `φ`
a local test on the ball. -/

/-! ## What the measurability condition of the class buys

The class sees `v` only through

* the *lower* Lebesgue integral `∫⁻ x in V, ENNReal.ofReal |w n x - v x|`, which
  is a supremum over simple functions **below** the integrand and is therefore
  blind to any perturbation supported on a set of inner measure zero; and
* the Bochner integrals of `HasWeakGradientOn`, which value a non-integrable
  integrand at `0`.

The two lemmas below make the reduction formal: any `v` that is invisible to
both lands in the local class with zero weak gradient, whatever its
measurability.  Instantiating with the indicator of a Bernstein set `B ⊆ ℝ^d`
— every measurable subset of `B` and of `Bᶜ` is null, so `B` has inner measure
`0` and full outer measure in every open set — would give a member of the wider
class that is not almost everywhere strongly measurable, hence not integrable on
any ball.  Bernstein sets are a ZFC construction and are not in Mathlib, so that
half is cited rather than formalized, and the possibility that the two classes
coincide is not ruled out here. -/

/-- A function whose lower Lebesgue integral vanishes on every ball, and whose

With the measurability condition present as a hypothesis the conclusion is
degenerate: those hypotheses together force the function to vanish almost
everywhere, so this construction exhibits nothing but the zero function.  It is
kept because it is the shape available before the class carried that condition,
and the difference between the two readings is exactly what the condition
buys. -/

/-! ## The class-level statements

The local class carries the measurability of its pair, so the statements above
may be restated with their measurability hypotheses discharged from the class
itself.  What remains assumed is the coefficient field, through local uniform
ellipticity: on every bounded set a pair of constants for that set. -/
