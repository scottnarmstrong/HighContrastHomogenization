# The canonical metric of a positive block

For a positive doubled block `E` the reference text sets, in
`e.scale.selection.canonical.metric`, `M(E) := E # E^♯` and
`𝔡(E) := |M(E)^{-1/2} E M(E)^{-1/2}|^2`.  The facts about the canonical metric
used in `p.global.selection` are that
`M(E)` is self-dual, that it has a unique factorization
`M(E) = G_{-g}^t diag(m, m^{-1}) G_{-g}` with `m` positive and `g` skew, that
`𝔡(E) = |(E^♯)^{-1/2} E (E^♯)^{-1/2}|`, and — when `E^♯ ≤ E` — the balance chain
`E^♯ ≤ M(E) ≤ E ≤ 𝔡(E)^{1/2} M(E)` together with `det M(E) = 1`.

Self-duality is the inverse and congruence clauses of the geometric-mean
toolkit applied to the reflection.  The factorization is self-duality read
through the Schur data: the sharp map sends `(s, s_*, k)` to `(s_*, s, -k^t)`,
so a self-dual block has `s = s_*` and `k` skew.  The imbalance identity is the
observation that the generalized eigenvalues of `E` relative to `E^♯` are those
of `C := M(E)^{-1/2} E M(E)^{-1/2}` relative to `C^{-1}`, that is the
eigenvalues of `C^2`.

The pair `(m, g)` is introduced by the well-definedness-first route: the
uniqueness theorem `existsUnique_canonFactor` comes first, the definition
`canonFactor` is made by choice, and `canonFactor_spec` and `canonFactor_eq`
then characterize it, so that nothing downstream depends on the choice.
