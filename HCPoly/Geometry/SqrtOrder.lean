# Operator monotonicity of the square root

The joint monotonicity of the matrix geometric mean rests on the fact that
`H ↦ H^{1/2}` is monotone for the Loewner order.  The reference text proves that
from the integral representation of the matrix square root; the argument here is
the equivalent norm argument, which needs no vector-valued integral.

Write `S`, `T` for the square roots of `A ≤ B`, with `B` positive definite, and
put `W := T^{-1/2} S T^{-1/2}`.  Conjugating `A ≤ B` by `T^{-1}` shows that
`(S T^{-1})^t (S T^{-1}) ≤ I`, so `‖S T^{-1}‖ ≤ 1`.  The powers of `W` telescope
through `S T^{-1}`, so `‖W^m‖` is bounded uniformly in `m`, while `‖W^{2^k}‖`
equals `‖W‖^{2^k}` because `W` is symmetric.  Hence `‖W‖ ≤ 1`, that is `W ≤ I`,
and conjugating back gives `S ≤ T`.
