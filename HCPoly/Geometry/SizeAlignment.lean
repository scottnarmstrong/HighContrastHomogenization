# One scalar size, two encodings

A doubled block is measured against a positive reference block in two ways in
this development.

The setup layer uses the Loewner recipe stated for the reference imbalance:
`blockSize H F` is the least `t ≥ 0` with `-tF ≤ H ≤ tF`, an infimum
taken in the structural block dialect and involving no matrix square root.  The
canonical block geometry uses the spectral recipe
`relSize P Q = ‖Q^{-1/2} P Q^{-1/2}‖` on the flattened carrier.

On a positive semidefinite numerator and a positive definite denominator the two
recipes name the same real number, and this file proves it.  Two observations
are all that is needed.  First, `relSize P Q` is the least element of the set of
nonnegative scalars `t` with `P ≤ tQ`, by `relSize_le_iff` together with
`le_relSize_smul`, so it is that set's infimum.  Second, the extra lower
constraint `-tF ≤ H` carried by the defining set of `blockSize` is vacuous once
`0 ≤ H`, `0 ≤ F` and `0 ≤ t`, so the two defining sets coincide after the
bridge of `HCPoly.Geometry.BlockBridge` transports the quadratic-form order to
the Loewner order.

The consequence recorded last is the identity a consumer of the reference
imbalance needs: the reference ratio `κ_𝐄` of the setup layer and the imbalance
`𝔡(𝐄)` of `e.response.canonical.imbalance` are literally the same real number.
The companion statement for the excess size reads `blockExcess H F` off the same
relative size, normalized by one.

/-- **The setup layer's scalar size is the relative size of the canonical block
geometry.**  Positive semidefiniteness of the numerator is what makes the lower
Loewner constraint `-tF ≤ H` of `blockSize` vacuous, so that the defining set of
`blockSize H F` is exactly the set of nonnegative scalar Loewner bounds whose
least element is `relSize`. -/
