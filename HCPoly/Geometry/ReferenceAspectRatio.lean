# The reference aspect ratio of `e.coarse.ellipticity` is at least one

The reference block `E` of the coarse ellipticity assumption dominates the coarse
response of every standard aligned cube, with a discount factor `3^{g(m-k)}`
that is one at the scale of the cube itself.  So `E` dominates the coarse
response of a centered triadic cube at some field of the coefficient space,
provided one such field is reachable — which is exactly what a probability law
supplies, since the assumption's bound holds almost surely and the source scale
`S` is finite at every field.

The Schur blocks of a realized coarse response are ordered, so its aspect ratio
is at least one; the aspect ratio is monotone; hence `1 ≤ Π(E)`.  This is the
lower bound `Θ ≥ 1` the reference text uses, obtained without assuming the
ordering of the reference block itself.

The hypothesis that the law is a probability measure is not cosmetic: at the
zero measure the assumption is satisfied by a reference block with `Π = 1/4`,
because nothing is then reachable.
