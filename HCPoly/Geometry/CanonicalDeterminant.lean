# The determinant clause of the canonical balance

The determinant clause of the canonical balance reads determinants in the
balance chain `M(E) ≤ E ≤ 𝔡(E)^{1/2} M(E)`.  Since `det M(E) = 1` and the
matrices have size `2d`, this is `1 ≤ det(E) ≤ 𝔡(E)^d`, the determinant bound
used in `p.global.selection`, written before the `d`-th root is taken.
