# The canonical metric of a reference block

The reference-radius estimate in `e.initial.geometry.bounds` reads the canonical
balance chain on the lower-right principal blocks.  If the Schur
data of a self-dominating block `E` are `(s, s_*, k)`, the balance chain
`E^♯ ≤ M(E) ≤ E` becomes `s^{-1} ≤ m(E)^{-1} ≤ s_*^{-1}`, that is
`s_* ≤ m(E) ≤ s`; the aspect bounds `λ_0 I ≤ s_*` and `s ≤ Λ_0 I` of
`e.reference.aspect.ratio` then place `m(E)` between `λ_0 I` and `Λ_0 I` and bound
its projective distance to the identity by `(1/2) log Π`.

Both statements here are about the matrix core of the corollary and carry no
probabilistic hypothesis: the reference block enters through its Schur data and
through the hypothesis `E^♯ ≤ E`, which for the coefficient law of
`e.coarse.ellipticity` is the primal-adjoint order for the reference block.
