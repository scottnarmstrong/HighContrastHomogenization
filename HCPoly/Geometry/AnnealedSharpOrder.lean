# The annealed sharp order

The annealed primal-adjoint order says that the expectation of the random block
matrix `A(U)` dominates its own sharp: `E(U)^♯ ≤ E(U)`.  The reference proof has
three moves: an algebraic identity, an external pathwise bound, and matrix
Jensen.

The primal-adjoint involution `F ↦ R F⁻¹ R` and the dual block, formed with the
swap matrix `R` of `s.scale.selection`, make the inverse of the sharp
conjugation by the reflection, so the random matrix `Z := R A R` has `Z⁻¹ = A^♯`;
that is `fullBlockSharp_inv` below.  The pathwise block order, which gives
`0 < A^♯ ≤ A` along every realization, is one of the properties of the coarse
block that `s.introduction` takes from HC: it is not proved here and appears as
the explicit hypothesis `hsharp`.  It is what makes
both `Z` and `Z⁻¹` integrable, so that no inverse moment is needed.  Matrix
Jensen then gives `(E Z)⁻¹ ≤ E (Z⁻¹)`, and the chain

`E(U)^♯ = (E Z)⁻¹ ≤ E (Z⁻¹) = E (A^♯) ≤ E (A) = E(U)`

closes the lemma, the last step being monotonicity of the average.
