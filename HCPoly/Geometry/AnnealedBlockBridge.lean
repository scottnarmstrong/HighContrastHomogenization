# The annealed sharp order on the coarse block response

The annealed primal-adjoint order is proved on the flattened carrier, for an
abstract random positive definite doubled matrix.  The paper's own random matrix
is the variational coarse block `𝐀(U; a)` of `s.introduction`, whose average
`𝐀̄(U)` is defined one scalar Bochner integral per entry.  This file transports
the abstract statement onto that carrier.

Two facts do the transporting.  The first is that the entrywise definition of
`𝐀̄(U)` really is the Bochner integral of the matrix-valued map: a matrix over a
finite index type is the finite sum `∑ i, ∑ j, M i j • single i j 1` of scalar
multiples of fixed single-entry matrices, so entrywise integrability is
integrability, and the vector-valued integral is computed entrywise.  The second
is the bridge of the two block dialects, which carries the sharp involution, the
Loewner order and positive definiteness across.

The integrability of the pathwise sharp is not an extra assumption.  The
reference proof observes that the elementary bounds for the coarse block
sandwich `0 < 𝐀^♯(U) ≤ 𝐀(U)`, so the spectral norm of the sharp is dominated
by the spectral norm of the response itself and no inverse moment is needed.
What that argument still requires is measurability of the sharp, which is
supplied here from measurability of the entries of the response: the entries of
the inverse are the adjugate entries divided by the determinant, and both are
polynomial in the entries.

/-! ## Matrix-valued integrals from scalar entries

Everything in this section is generic: a matrix over a finite index type is a
finite sum of scalar multiples of fixed single-entry matrices, so every entrywise
hypothesis propagates to the matrix-valued map. -/
