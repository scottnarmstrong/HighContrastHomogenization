# The sharp involution and the shear

On a doubled block matrix the reference text sets `R := (0 I; I 0)`, the swap
matrix of `s.scale.selection`, and `H^♯ := R H^{-1} R`, and writes
`G_h := (I 0; h I)` for the shear.  This file fixes both on the flattened carrier
`FullBlockMat d`, where the doubled index type is a sum type and
`Matrix.fromBlocks` is available, and proves the rules for the primal-adjoint
involution together with its invariance under a constant skew shear: the sharp
map is an involution, it reverses the Loewner order, it is homogeneous of degree
minus one, and it commutes with congruence by a shear along a skew matrix.

The recentering identity rests on the two displayed identities of the reference
proof, `R G_h^{-1} = G_h^t R` and `G_h^{-t} R = R G_h`, valid exactly because `h`
is skew.
