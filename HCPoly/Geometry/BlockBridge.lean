# The bridge between the two block dialects

A doubled block matrix is carried in two equivalent ways.  The structural
carrier `BlockMat d` records the four `d × d` corners separately and comes with
its own multiplication, transpose, inverse, dilation, reflection, quadratic-form
order `BlockMatLoewnerLE`, and positivity predicate `BlockPosDef`.  The
flattened carrier `FullBlockMat d = Matrix (BlockCoord d) (BlockCoord d) ℝ` is a
genuine matrix ring over the doubled index type, so it carries mathlib's
multiplication, inverse, Loewner order, `PosDef`, and square root; the canonical
block geometry of `e.scale.selection.canonical.metric` is developed there.

This file shows that the flattening map `toFullBlockMat` identifies the two:
it is a ring isomorphism onto `FullBlockMat d` sending each structural operation
to its matrix counterpart, and — on symmetric data — it identifies
`BlockMatLoewnerLE` with the Loewner order and `BlockPosDef` with `PosDef`.

Symmetry is needed for one direction only.  A Loewner inequality between
flattened matrices always implies the corresponding inequality of quadratic
forms; the converse needs the difference to be Hermitian, which for real data is
exactly the symmetry of the two blocks.  This asymmetry is recorded in the two
one-directional lemmas, and `blockMatLoewnerLE_iff_le` assumes symmetry of both
arguments.

The final section transports the primal-adjoint involution `H^♯ = R H^{-1} R`,
formed with the swap matrix `R` of `s.scale.selection`.  The structural
`blockSharp` and the flattened `fullBlockSharp` correspond under the bridge with
no hypotheses at all, so its rules — involution, order reversal, homogeneity of
degree minus one — become available in the structural dialect by transport.

/-! ## Order transport

Only the passage from the quadratic-form order to the Loewner order needs
symmetry, and it needs it on both arguments: the Loewner order is defined by
positive semidefiniteness of the difference, and a real matrix is positive
semidefinite only if it is symmetric. -/

hypothesis is needed in this direction. -/
